# Roadmap — Proof of Mind value chain (PRIVATE)

> Stealth. Release when matured. Phases are dependency-ordered; the load-bearing
> risk (un-gameable `v(S)`) gates everything downstream, so it comes early.

## Tier legend
- ✅ **demonstrated** — runs, tested on real blocks this session
- 🟡 **designed** — specified, not yet built
- 🔬 **research** — open problem, no settled approach

## Phase 0 — Foundation (DONE this session)
- ✅ Block ownership, Bitcoin-shaped (UTXO fold over signed transfer log); transfer
  voids prior attestation. `block-ownership.py`
- ✅ Per-block Ed25519 signing; tamper-resistance (signed Merkle root, keyless
  re-baseline caught at boot). `integrity-attest.py`
- ✅ Synergy value v0→v2: coverage outcome-value + Myerson (sampled) + Bradley-Terry;
  Shapley made load-bearing (L1≈0.26 vs additive). `block-value-v2.py`
- ✅ PoM score = per-owner Myerson value → consensus weight. `pom-score.py`
- ✅ Privacy: private repo + nda-locked + fail-closed sync leak-gate.

## Phase 1 — Make the measurement un-gameable (THE gate; do first)
The whole system is only as honest as `v(S)`. Until this is solid, everything above
is a reputation system.
- 🟡 **Learned reward-model `v(S)`** — Bradley-Terry over block features → generalizes
  to unseen blocks (RLHF reward model). Replaces the coverage proxy. `reward-model.py`
- 🟡 **Outcome-value labels** — coalition-level "how good is the outcome using only S"
  judgments (model/jury, DeepFunding-distill over *sets*).
- 🔬 **Strategyproofness** — anti-sybil / anti-split / anti-padding. Port the
  contribution-graph Goodhart defenses (decay, reviewer-diversity, split-credit) +
  prove no profitable manipulation of `v(S)`.

## Phase 2 — Recursion & flow
- 🟡 **Two-level recursion** — intra-block share vectors (multi-contributor blocks)
  computed by the same Myerson game one level down.
- 🟡 **Eigenvector value-flow** — value propagates backward through the provenance /
  attribution DAG (EigenTrust / PageRank-style), with damping to defeat self-reference.
- 🔬 **Temporal flow** — round-to-round value (iterated-Shapley / fairness-fixed-point);
  bound drift.

## Phase 3 — Consensus
- 🟡 **PoM-weighted finalization** — agreement on the canonical chain weighted by PoM.
- 🟡 **Stability** — core / nucleolus constraint so no validator coalition profits by
  deviating (defection-proof).
- 🟡 **Slashing** — revoke PoM for refuted blocks (caught hallucinations, failed
  reveals, invalid attestations); commit-reveal for live block authorship.

## Phase 4 — Backwards-enforcement of the model
- 🟡 **Training-signal export** — value-weighted dataset from high-PoM verified blocks.
- 🔬 **Open-weight fine-tune loop** — governance truth → gradient → model; verify →
  compound. (Depends on the open-weights migration.)

## Phase 5 — Hardening & release
- 🟡 Adversarial audit (RSAW on the mechanism), external-economist critique pass.
- 🟡 Reference implementation + whitepaper v1.0.
- Release — matured, with the head-start banked.

## Loops (self-perpetuating, private)

The roadmap shouldn't depend on one long session. Proposed loops, each writing only
to the private repo:

1. **Roadmap-advance loop** — pick the next 🟡 item, do one increment, commit. The
   "start and don't stop" mechanism. (Set up this session.)
2. **PoM-scoring loop** — as new session-chain blocks accrue, score them (value-flow +
   reward-model) → refresh PoM scores → commit. Keeps the value chain live.
3. **Adversarial-gaming loop (RSAW on the mechanism)** — each tick, *try to game* `v(S)`
   (cheap PoM inflation: sybil split, redundant padding, self-attribution ring). If a
   manipulation is found, patch it + add a defense + a regression. This is how Phase 1's
   un-gameable-`v(S)` actually gets hardened — by an adversary that never sleeps.
4. **Reward-model retraining loop** — as pairwise/outcome labels accumulate, retrain
   the reward model; track held-out accuracy; flag drift.

The adversarial-gaming loop is the highest-leverage: the whole system's honesty rests
on un-gameable measurement, so a standing adversary against `v(S)` is the moat.

## Critical path
Phase 1 (un-gameable `v(S)`) → Phase 2 (recursion/flow) → Phase 3 (consensus) → Phase 4
(backwards-enforcement). Phase 1 is the gate: do not ship consensus on a measurement
that can be gamed.
