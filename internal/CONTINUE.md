# CONTINUE — Noesis handoff (PUBLIC since 2026-06-29 — build in the open, honesty is the moat)

> **DESIGN CONSTRAINT (Will 2026-06-13):** keep noesis CODE-LEAN, simplicity like Bitcoin. No
> over-the-top developing. Every increment = minimal mechanism that earns its place; prefer
> delete/simplify; pay duplication debt (single-source from noesis-core). Rigor ≠ bloat.

## 🔝🔝🔝 NEXT SESSION (2026-07-13 PM) — v(S) SEAM ✅ · EQUIVOCATION ✅ · T1 SLICE-1/2/3 (persist+codec · transport · gossip) ✅ · next = slice-4 (sync = the join)

Human recap: `sessions/2026-07-13-oracle-seam-equivocation-and-where-the-ai-lives.md`. All pushed, HEAD == origin @ `f862431`.

**✅ BUILT this session (PM):**
- **v(S) ValueOracle seam** (`6fe4552`) — `node/src/lib.rs`: `trait ValueOracle` + `NoveltyOracleV0` (v0, honest designed-not-learned) + `pom_scores_with_oracle`; `pom_scores_with_similarity_floor_q16` delegates (byte-identical). Tests `node/tests/value_oracle_seam.rs` (parity + real-swap). Contract + governance-gated upgrade path: `docs/DESIGN-value-oracle-seam.md`. THE swap point where a learned v(S) drops in later, no rebuild.
- **Equivocation slashing on the LIVE path** (`536d6e2`) — `node/src/runtime.rs`: `finalizes_guarded` + `Node::checkpoint_finalizes_guarded` run the A4 guard (slash-before-count) on the finality decision. Tests `node/tests/equivocation_live_path.rs` (honest-parity + flip + slash). HONEST: decision protected + offender reported; PERSISTENT slash across epochs still needs the T1 validator registry.
- **Honesty pre-commit gate** (`815cbdf`) — babel-test-lint wired fail-closed into `scripts/pre-commit`.
- **CRPC / where-the-AI-lives synthesis** (`7181969`, designed/sketch) — `docs/research/crpc-second-meta-consensus-sketch.md`: SLMs = node-oracles disciplined by Tim Cotten's CRPC over sharded UTXO; chain = harness; PoM v(S) = value-instance of CRPC's graded-agreement; non-interference = the load-bearing open proof. Tim Cotten credited (his spec, deleted/404, Wayback-archived).

**⛔ BLOCKED — verified this session, do NOT build:** the constitutional dimension-set amendment surface. `amendment.rs` already has AddDimension/RetireDimension/ReweightDimension variants that correctly reject with `ConstitutionalPending` (`amendment.rs:210-212`) because `Constitution` has NO dimension matrix (only scalars). Making them real needs building the dimension matrix first (big, not code-lean) AND its coherence is partner-deferred to the Pragma confluence engine (`amendment.rs:369-372`). Don't spend effort here.

**✅ T1 slice-1 BUILT (`621c2d3`, pushed)** — `node/src/wire.rs`: `encode_block`/`decode_block` + an append-only `BlockLog`, via SELF-CONTAINED serde mirror structs (`W*`) + conversions — NO serde on any consensus type, and `noesis-core` (no_std, RISC-V) stays serde-free (serialization kept a node-layer concern). Registered `pub mod wire` in `lib.rs`. Tests `node/tests/persistence_roundtrip.rs`: restart-from-log → **byte-identical `state_digest`** ✅ + codec byte-stability + corrupt-log-fails-loud. State = replay(canonical blocks), Bitcoin-style (reuses `Node::apply` + `Ledger::state_digest`).

**✅ T1 slice-2 (transport) BUILT `55bd8be` · slice-3 (gossip) BUILT `9aa02e0`** — pushed. `node/src/net.rs` (`write_frame`/`read_frame` u32-length frames, `Peer`, `Listener`; std::net + threads, ZERO deps, `MAX_FRAME` 16 MiB DoS bound) + `node/src/gossip.rs` (`Gossip` seen-set dedup via domain-separated blake2b + `broadcast` fan-out; flood TERMINATES via dedup). Tests: `node/tests/transport_framing.rs`, `node/tests/gossip_flood.rs`.

**▶ NEXT — T1 slice-4 (sync = THE join payoff):** a joining node connects to a peer, requests its block log, receives the blocks as frames, decodes each via slice-1 `wire::decode_block`, replays via `Node::apply` on a fresh genesis → converges to a byte-identical `state_digest`. Reuses slice-1 (`BlockLog` / `decode_block` / `Ledger::state_digest`) + slice-2 (`Peer` / frames). Needs a tiny request/response protocol: a `GET_BLOCKS` request frame → a stream of block frames → a done marker. Then slice-5: wire into `noesisd` (`--listen` / `--connect` mode) + a two-node local-join integration test (two processes, one joins the other, converge to identical state = the demoable payoff). Public testnet = deploy one seed node (Will infra) once code works.

**Survivability (session theme):** Software Heritage permanent archive ACCEPTED (id 2390230). Will-action: add ONE mirror remote (2nd host) — last gap. New standing priority: free-tier JARVIS = anti-capture defense (`memory/feedback_free-tier-jarvis-as-anti-capture-defense.md`).

**NOTE:** the Pragma-socket block immediately below is DONE (built AM `6ce3976`/`18b7c28`); kept for reference.

## NEXT SESSION (2026-07-13 AM, DONE) — PRAGMA LAYER: governance socket ✅ BUILT · next = Family-B checks
Will 2026-07-12: *"rotate and we build the Pragma layer to cover the final axis."* Per-execution FV is
DONE + machine-checked (Phase 4 ✅ all 3 steps green — see the stateless-verification block below).

**✅ BUILT 2026-07-13 (`6ce3976`, pushed)** — the socket's GOVERNANCE-LAYER slice: `node/src/amendment.rs`
(typed `Amendment` + `obligations()` checklist + `verify_amendment` gate; REAL safety bounds — 2/3
`threshold_bps` floor, `theta_sim_q16` ≤ 1.0, `mix` normalized, `max_mempool` ≥ 1 — + stale-base
rejection; physics→reject, constitutional dimension moves→`ConstitutionalPending`; 13 tests w/ RED twins,
full lib suite 308 green, 0 new clippy). Design note §9 grains 2+3 = DONE.
**✅ FAMILY-B DONE 2026-07-13 (`18b7c28`, pushed)** — `attribution_verdicts()` + `family_b_at_risk()` in
`node/src/amendment.rs`: per-property verdict (PreservedByConstruction / AtRisk / DeferredToPragma) grounded
in `runtime.rs:748` (only `theta_sim_q16` reaches `pom_scores`). Anti-theater: the sole non-trivial case is a
`theta_sim` RAISE → AtRisk on null-player; mix + finalization params preserved-by-construction; constitutional
moves deferred. +5 tests, amendment 18 green, full lib suite 313 green, 0 new clippy.
**▶ SOCKET NOW FEATURE-COMPLETE for the deploy-independent, no-partner-terms slice.** What remains is NOT ours
to build alone: (1) the confluence discharge + full attribution-preservation *proof* = Pragma's engine
(TERMS-FIRST — Will drives Tom Lindeman + Bernhard); (2) the constitutional dimension-set amendment surface is
`pending` upstream (`Constitution` dimension matrix) — build that first if we want `AddDimension`/`RetireDimension`
to do more than `ConstitutionalPending`. Other deploy-independent Noesis grains continue per the RESUME blocks below.
The remaining axis = **rule-set-mutation coherence** (the 2nd line of defence): when governance AMENDS
the Constitution, does it stay confluent AND keep the axioms (I1–I4 value + the Shapley 5-axiom
attribution set)? Line-1 covers a FIXED rulebook; this covers the SPACE of governable rulebooks. Tom's
danger quadrant = Confluent + Axiom-breaking ("nobody checks that today").

**BUILD ORDER (socket-first; ours to build with no partner terms):**
1. **The socket (ours, public, build-in-open):** make the Noesis Constitution-amendment surface an
   EXPLICIT, inspectable rule-set mutation with the axiom obligations stated alongside it. TODAY the
   amendment RULES are `pending` (a constitutional-cell + verifier-gate — see the 3-layer governance in
   the `Constitution` struct doc, `node/src/runtime.rs`: physics near-immutable / constitutional
   amendment-rules verifier-gated / weights governance-bounded). So: (a) define the amendment op as a
   typed inspectable mutation of the measurement matrix; (b) state the per-amendment axiom obligations
   (value I1–I4 + Shapley 5-axiom). START with a `docs/` design note (Will greenlit).
2. **Confluence attach point:** where a pre-merge confluence + axiom-preservation check hooks the
   amendment op (Tom's design = sub-second pre-merge CI hook, not an offline audit).
3. **Actual Pragma integration = terms-in-writing-first** (business material; Will drives the
   POC/relationship — Tom Lindeman + Bernhard Mueller, [[pragma-confluence-governance-fv]]). The socket
   makes Will the POC ref-client (Noesis amendments + the VibeSwap audit-arsenal rule-mutation corpus =
   their "real client data").

**Anti-hallucination:** RE-VERIFY the `Constitution` 3-layer governance + the `pending` amendment-rule
status at `node/src/runtime.rs` (Constitution struct doc) before building. Read `docs/phase4-fv-plan.md`
(Pragma section) + `docs/Pragma Overlaps/noesis-pragma-overlap.md` first. ALSO STILL OPEN: the ρ/φ
changeset (Will's commit-or-discard; see REPO STATE at the bottom of this file).

## 🔝🔝 RESUME HERE (2026-07-12 PM — STATELESS-VERIFICATION ENGAGEMENT, Phase 0+1 shipped)
**Separate track from the vesting-`W` work below.** Goal: nodes verify Noesis state+history trustlessly &
cheaply via **UTXO ⊕ recursive-zkVM validity proofs ⊕ formal verification** (3 codependent axes — rules
easy to STATE / FOLLOWED / RIGHT). Boundaries named in every report: NOT canonicality, NOT data
availability (both stay with consensus). Constraint: **engineer, not cryptographer** — no novel crypto;
zkVM = RISC Zero (already wired in `onchain/zk-finalize`) or SP1; accumulators = audited libs; every perf
number from code actually run (no mocked benchmarks). Docs: `docs/rulebook-map.md` (Phase 0),
`docs/phase1-extraction-report.md` (Phase 1).

- **Phase 0 ✅** (`771a1ee`) — `docs/rulebook-map.md`. Verdict: `Node::apply` (`runtime.rs:612-658`) is
  ALREADY pure/deterministic/integer (verified at source, incl. q16 PoM float-freeness `lib.rs:6514` +
  SMT root order-invariance `lib.rs:8070`). Hash = blake2b+sha256 on-path (zkVM-ok); keccak only in host
  JSON export. No secp256k1/BLS on the Rust path.
- **Phase 1 ✅** (`592d66e`) — extracted the pure rulebook `runtime::apply_block(state, block, params)
  -> Result<Ledger, Violation>` (= `validate_block` + `apply_transition` + typed `Violation`);
  `Node::validate`/`apply` are now thin callers. Replay-parity GREEN (`node/tests/apply_block_parity.rs`,
  byte-identical `state_digest` vs old path over the two_node vectors). **351 tests green** (was 349+2),
  0 new clippy. Pushed `origin/master` @ `6541479`.
- **Phase 2 ✅** (`78290ba`) — Compact state (no ZK). Audited UTXO-set commitment. **Decision resolved =
  B (audited, vendored)** after Will interrogated A/B (crypto-agnosticism / trusted-3rd-party / purity):
  the CKB `sparse-merkle-tree` won't build here (needs a C compiler — absent) and its C blake2b breaks the
  RISC-V path, so we **VENDORED + STRIPPED** it to pure Rust (`onchain/vendor/sparse-merkle-tree` — C hasher
  removed, Noesis's `blake2b-ref` plugged via the `Hasher` trait: audited algorithm, no C, RISC-V-clean, no
  trusted 3rd party). `node/src/utxo_commitment.rs`: membership + non-membership proofs + assumeutxo
  checkpoint. 358 green (+7), 0 new clippy. **Additive** (shadow-computed from `token_cells`; no consensus
  touch) ⇒ Phase-1 parity intact. Measured (release): proofs ~300–470 B; incremental update ~80–120 µs;
  shadow full-rebuild O(n)=2.02 s @10k ⇒ **incremental maintenance is the deploy step** (path exists,
  unwired). Report: `docs/phase2-commitment-report.md`.
- **▶ Phase 3 (NEXT) — zkVM PoC + honest cost report (human go/no-go).** ⚠ **No STARK prover on this Windows box**
  (no WSL2/Docker/r0vm/rzup — README-confirmed) ⇒ real receipt + benchmarks require Linux/WSL2/CI.
  Prereqs from Phase 0/1: std→no_std container swap (`HashMap`/`HashSet` → `BTreeMap`/sorted-`Vec`) and
  the O(chain) full-chain PoM recompute (`runtime.rs` `apply_transition` step g) → bounded per-block delta.
  **DECISION = A (Will 2026-07-12).** Milestone-1 guest LOGIC built + **host-verified GREEN**:
  `node/src/utxo_commitment.rs::{transition, verify_transition, TransitionWitness}` — one SMT
  multi-proof verifies the touched keys at OLD values under `old_root` AND NEW values under `new_root`
  ⇒ an inclusion proof doubles as a transition proof. Test rejects forged-root / corrupt-proof /
  claim-spent-coin-survived (double-spend). This IS the zkVM guest program, host-proven.
  **⚑ B DEFERRED to a Linux env (Will's dev note, 2026-07-12):** the real STARK receipt + proving-cost
  numbers need Linux/WSL2/CI (this box has no prover + no C compiler). B plan + the `no_std` lift +
  the `onchain/zk-utxo/` scaffold: **`docs/phase3-zk-plan.md`** + the DEV NOTE in `utxo_commitment.rs`.
  Do NOT claim "ZK ships" until a receipt verifies. (RISC Zero accelerates SHA-256, not blake2b —
  measure that cost.)
- **Phase 4 — FV (2026-07-12): Steps 1 ✅ + 2 ✅ + 3 ✅ ALL MACHINE-CHECKED GREEN — Phase 4 (per-execution invariants) COMPLETE per the plan's acceptance.** Commits: `4fdc34b` (Step 1 — 11 `node/tests/fv_invariants.rs` property tests, no-dep xorshift to dodge the `dlltool` blocker) · `1eb0373` (Step 2 — spec-oracle differential vs an independent BTreeMap model, no divergence) · `6068168`+ (Step 3 — `internal/fv/Noesis_Rulebook.thy`: `conservation` + `no_double_spend` + `determinism` discharged under a **locally-installed Isabelle2025**, 0 `sorry`; reproducible via `internal/fv/verify.sh`, pinned URL+sha256; model-to-code gap G-a..G-e enumerated in the README). Isabelle install lives at `C:/Users/Will/Isabelle2025` (bundle at `C:/Users/Will/isabelle-install/`). **Remaining = SEPARATE optional 2nd-line-of-defence axis:** rule-set-mutation coherence (Pragma Confluence) on the Constitution-amendment surface — do NOT conflate with the per-execution invariants ([[pragma-confluence-governance-fv]]). Full plan:
  **`docs/phase4-fv-plan.md`**. Ladder, cheapest-first: **(1)** `proptest` property tests over `apply_block`
  in `node/tests/fv_invariants.rs` — I1 value-conservation · I2/I3 no-double-spend (in+cross-block) · I4
  no-spend-of-nonexistent · I5 determinism-under-reserialization (each with an anti-theater RED check) →
  **(2)** spec-oracle differential (`apply_block` vs a ~50-line `BTreeMap` reference model; note: old-vs-new
  is ALREADY covered by `apply_block_parity` + `core_drift_guard`, so don't invent a legacy path) → **(3)**
  Isabelle/HOL `internal/fv/Noesis_Rulebook.thy` proving `conservation` + `no_double_spend` over an abstract
  value-model, **model-to-code gap enumerated** for Will's review. **Pragma Coherence** = a SEPARATE,
  optional layer for the Constitution-amendment (rule-set-mutation) surface — complementary, do NOT force
  onto the UTXO invariants (read `docs/Pragma Overlaps/noesis-pragma-overlap.md` first). **Start with Step 1**
  (highest value; surfaces edge cases before any Isabelle).

Task board (JARVIS-side): tasks #1-5. Memory: [[noesis-stateless-verification]]. The uncommitted
ρ/φ-numerology working-tree changeset (background RSAW loop) is LEFT UNTOUCHED for Will's deliberate
commit-or-discard decision.

## 🔝 RESUME HERE (2026-07-12 — vesting-`W` Phase 2 BUILT; Phase 3 is the last consensus-affecting stage)
The cleared-score bridge is shipped. `DESIGN-vesting-W-and-standing-bridge.md` Phases 1 (`finalized_at`
stamp) and 2 (`Constitution.vesting_w` + `Node::finality_pom_weight` cliff bridge) are BUILT; node lib
**284 green**. This closed the roadmap top-blocker's data-model + bridge halves — `Validator.pom` now has a
production source (cleared standing = v(S) that survived `W` of dispute exposure), where before it existed
only in test constructors. RSAW log: `ROADMAP.md` (P2, newest-first).

**✅ BUILT 2026-07-12 (vesting-`W` Phase 3 — dispute-during-`W`, design §2.4 / §3 stage 3).** The
finality rail now responds to a refutation. `runtime.rs`: `Ledger.refuted: HashSet<cell_id>` +
`Node::record_refutation(target, &dispute::Settlement)` (records the target cell iff the settlement
actually CANCELED unvested value — an upheld/acquitted challenge returns a zero/empty settlement and
records NOTHING) + a 2nd filter in `finality_pom_weight` (`past_cliff && !refuted.contains(id)`).
RED→GREEN: a refuted-while-pending cell contributes ZERO finality weight even after it ages past `W`;
an un-refuted sibling still clears (no over-exclusion); forward-only (`record_refutation` leaves
`state_digest`/height/cells byte-identical — no past block un-finalizes); anti-theater (drop the filter
⇒ RED). Node lib 293→295 green, 0 new clippy.
**🟡 REMAINING (deploy-coupled, designed-not-built):** `refuted` is populated out-of-band, so unlike
`finalized_at` (block-replay-derivable) it is NOT yet history-derivable — embedding dispute resolutions
into the replayable block/Op stream (so replicas converge on `refuted`) is the remaining wiring, same
class as the crypto-nullifier / on-VM UTXO retirement. This build = the reference mechanism + its
forward-only exclusion property, NOT cross-replica determinism. Grounding kept below for provenance.

**GROUNDED 2026-07-12 (the sharpened gap — load-bearing, discovered while teeing this up):** `Op::Slash(d)`
reduces only the **Standing SCALAR** (`st.pom.saturating_sub(d)`, `lib.rs:495`), but `Node::finality_pom_weight`
recomputes finality PoM **from the cleared CELL set** (`pom_scores_with_similarity_floor_q16` over cells with
`finalized_at ≤ now − W`) and NEVER reads the Standing scalar or any slash state. ⇒ **the two are on different
rails: a slash today does NOTHING to finality weight** — so a gamed cell refuted while pending would still age
into finality. THAT is exactly what Phase 3 must close (and it makes the bridge non-circular in code).

**Mechanism (contained; mirrors the `finalized_at` pattern):** add node-side `Ledger.refuted: HashSet<cell_id>`
→ `finality_pom_weight` excludes refuted cells (2nd filter alongside the cliff) → wire the dispute resolution
to record the refuted cell id when a refutation lands. Forward-only (past finalized checkpoints never
un-finalize; only FUTURE finality weight loses the bad cell). Uses the dispute `window` (D1) as the exposure clock.

**RED→GREEN tests:** (i) finalize a cell, slash/refute it while pending (< `W`), advance past `W` ⇒ it
contributes ZERO to `finality_pom_weight` (a would-clear cell never clears); (ii) an un-refuted cell that
survives `W` still clears (no over-exclusion); (iii) refuting a cell does NOT un-finalize a past block
(forward-only); (iv) anti-theater: remove the refuted-filter ⇒ (i) goes RED.

**Anti-hallucination — RE-VERIFY at source (do NOT trust these or memory; Phase-2 shifted line numbers):**
VERIFIED this session — `FINALITY_MIX` `runtime.rs:726`, `MIN_DIM_BPS 5000` `:738`, `dim_ok` `:740`,
`finalizes_pos_pom` `:750`. RE-GREP before relying — the `finalized_at.entry(...)` stamp in `apply()`,
`pub fn finality_pom_weight`, and the dispute resolution path (`resolve_refuted` / `dispute` mod, `lib.rs
~4299`). The learned-v(S)-on-real-labels mile is still THE moat (data-blocked); `W` is only its launch stand-in.

**▶ ITEM B — accountable safety / equivocation slashing (council-confirmed 2026-07-12). GUARD BUILT
2026-07-12 (B1); only LIVE-WIRING remains.** The mechanism half is shipped: `runtime::finality::
epoch_equivocators` + `finalizes_with_equivocation_guard` (slash-before-count, BTree-deterministic,
reuses `is_equivocation`; node lib 285 green, RSAW B1). **REMAINING (build COLD):** thread a per-epoch
ballot list `(validator_id, proposal_id)` into the LIVE finality path so `runtime::finalizes` /
`Node::checkpoint_finalizes` call the guard instead of bare `finalizes_pos_pom`, and apply
`consensus::slash` to the returned equivocator ids on the persistent validator set. That live-wiring is
what actually CLOSES the `[GAP]` in production (the guard alone makes it closable, not closed). Original
grounding kept below.

Real + self-labeled open: `A4 [GAP] Lifecycle omitted: equivocation slashing` (`lib.rs:4118`). Primitives
EXIST but are test-only-wired — `is_equivocation(prev_vote_this_epoch, this_proposal)` (`lib.rs:3876`) +
validator `slash()` (`lib.rs:3840`). `finality::finalizes_pos_pom` is STATELESS (`voters_for` + `all`, no
vote history) ⇒ structurally cannot detect a double-vote. **Fix = slash-before-count** ([[slash-before-count]]):
thread a per-epoch vote-ledger (validator→proposal) into the finality path; BEFORE summing weight, run
`is_equivocation` per validator; a detected equivocator's vote is EXCLUDED (counted for neither proposal)
AND slashed. **RED→GREEN:** (i) a validator voting 2 different proposals in one epoch ⇒ weight excluded from
BOTH ⇒ its tainted weight never finalizes; (ii) the equivocator's stake slashed; (iii) an honest single vote
is unaffected; (iv) anti-theater: skip the check ⇒ tainted weight counts ⇒ (i) RED. Consensus-affecting +
adds vote-state ⇒ build COLD. Severity honest: a real OPEN item, NOT a live exploit (the anti-concentration
floor + PoW-out-of-finality carry other safety meanwhile). Re-verify the `is_equivocation`/`slash`/`[GAP]`
lines at source before building (Phase-2 shifted numbers).

## 🔝 RESUME HERE (2026-06-29 PM — #1 DONE, #2 design-pass DONE; #3 + two grains teed) [Will deciding finality, full-auto]
Full-auto session while Will decides PoM↔finality (that surface untouched). Progress on the approved builds:
1. **Resource-DoS bounding — Bound A SHIPPED ✅** (`de59148`←`b80896e`). `Constitution.max_mempool` cap; `Node::submit`
   returns `bool` + rejects admission when the pool is full — deterministic, economics-independent ceiling on mempool memory +
   per-proposal compute. Per-replica liveness/resource guard, NOT consensus-affecting (never enters `validate`; no finality
   touch). RED→GREEN `resource_dos_flood_is_bounded_by_mempool_cap`, full suite **318/318**, 0 new clippy. Design +
   SECURITY.md §2 honest update + ROADMAP (yy). **🟡 Bound B (NEXT, build fresh, consensus-adjacent):** the commit-deposit
   refunded on genuine contribution / forfeited on junk (K-junk flood costs K·d) — full build contract in
   `docs/RESOURCE-DOS-BOUNDING.md` §Bound B. Touches the value path ⇒ build cold.
2. **Isomorphism-invariance gate for v(S) — I-1 PROBE BUILT ✅** (`d689ef9`, 2026-06-29 full-auto). `value::tests::
   relabel_invariance_*` (3 tests): permutation leaves total `value_v8` BIT-EXACT (g=0.0); anti-theater teeth (label-sensitive v
   caught variant by same σ); sybil-split **FOUND A NEW GAP**. 321/321, 0 new clippy. Design + finding writeup: `docs/
   ISOMORPHISM-INVARIANCE-VS.md` §5 + §6.1. **★ FINDING — LINEAR SELF-FLOW-LAUNDERING (depth-axis):** peeling a self-built
   linear lineage's child onto a fresh identity relabels the vertical edge internal→external (`flow::children_of_external` counts
   only cross-identity edges) ⇒ `value_v8` pumps **+16.7** for identical work. The built BREADTH dampers (μ^m/λ^r/ρ^j) miss it
   (one child/parent ⇒ μ⁰=1) and ring detectors miss it (acyclic); only barrier = per-identity standing FLOOR cost. **SCOPE
   (calibrated):** value_v8 = moat-TARGET path; deployed runtime franchise = `pom_scores` (flow-free) ⇒ NOT exposed today.
   **NEXT grains:** (I-1b) lift the probe to the `pom_scores` franchise layer to confirm flow-free ⇒ immune; (I-2, build COLD,
   consensus-affecting) the structural close — subtract relabel-variant flow energy at scoring time so the same edge earns the
   same whether labeled internal or external. General gate stays 🔬 open (graph-iso-hard).
3. **Loop-synthesis components (approved, NOT yet started):** TRP2 non-regression acceptance gate (Self-Harness) · Noesis
   solver/legitimacy guard cand-B (auto-checks the θ_sim over-cut) · Story Mode fresh-zero-context evaluator (Kitchen Loop).
   Full synthesis: `~/Desktop/loop-engineering-self-improvement-synthesis-2026-06-29.md`.

**RESOLVED 2026-06-29 (Will ruled, security-expert call): PoM STAYS COUPLED to finality.** Will: *"coupled is the
only real answer here to be honest."* The built design stands — NO code change to `finalizes_pos_pom`. Rationale:
full-decouple forfeits anti-plutocracy = the thesis; the anti-concentration floor converts the welding risk from
"gaming OR capital" → "gaming AND capital" (conjunction). **The two real protections = anti-concentration floor +
un-gameability moat.** **Standing-slash REJECTED as a finality-safety property (circular: gamed-standing collateral
is fake; honest stakers co-signing a gamed checkpoint committed no objective fault).** Forward: keep PoW excluded
(done); consider a higher `MIN_DIM_BPS` for the safety path; residual = severe-undetected-gaming + cleared-floor =
exactly what the moat closes. Full record: `ARCHITECTURE.md` §Consensus DECISION + memory session-2026-06-29.

## 🔝 RESUME HERE (2026-06-29 — adversarial loop (xx): runtime near-dup floor) [full-auto, Will recovering]
- **BUILT ✅** closed a runtime gaming vector: the **paraphrase-padding sybil ring**. The live PoM path
  (`runtime.rs::apply` → `pom_scores` → plain `temporal_novelty`) was NOT using the near-dup similarity floor
  that already exists in the lib. A ring of K near-duplicate copies (few bytes flipped) leaked residual novelty
  and banked ~K cells of standing. Fix: `pom_scores_with_similarity_floor_q16` (deterministic, replica-safe)
  + `Constitution.theta_sim_q16` (0.95 default) routed through `apply`. New regression
  `paraphrase_padding_ring_cannot_multiply_standing_through_runtime` (RED on plain rule, GREEN with floor).
  **node suite 317/317 green, 0 new clippy.** Full write-up: ROADMAP.md adversarial-loop log **(xx)**.
- **⚑ WILL DECISION PENDING:** the floor is now *consensus-affecting* (PoM drives finality franchise). 0.95
  cuts only near-identical cells, but honest work with >95% coverage overlap would also be floored (lib note:
  ideally compose with the learned quality model, not yet in the runtime path). Is 0.95 the right consensus
  default, or hold the floor until the quality model is in-path? `theta_sim_q16` is a governable Constitution param.
- **NEXT (unchanged moat priority):** the faithful provenance-feature port over the Rust `outcome` set-level
  DAG features — the open real test after the (ww) learned-`v(S)` NULL result.

## 🔝 RESUME HERE (2026-06-23 ~12:30 — naming resolved + M1/M2 drafted)
- **NAMING (Will: "neutral everywhere"):** "Will's Equilibrium" → **Honest-Contribution Equilibrium (HCE)**
  across all active surfaces (roadmap spine, `node/src/lib.rs` comments, ROADMAP.md, STUDY-GUIDE.md,
  LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md). Eponymous filenames kept for path stability (`DESIGN-wills-equilibrium.md` since
  moved to `internal/thesis/`; `ROADMAP-WILLS-EQUILIBRIUM.md` stays in `internal/`); CONTINUE.md historical
  log-entries left as accurate record. Eponym retired per v4.0.
- **M1 DRAFTED** — `internal/thesis/DESIGN-wills-equilibrium.md` rewritten as the paper-grade formalization:
  game `Γ=(N,A,M,u)`, HCE definition (3 properties), prior-art positioning table (claim only the fusion),
  status-by-property (demonstrated/designed/open), existence as partial-proposition + labeled-conjecture,
  proof-obligations→enforcer table. Honest: HCE = result for (1)+(2-cyclic), conjecture for full three.
- **M2 DRAFTED** — `internal/thesis/DESIGN-adaptive-convergence-theorem.md`: the convergence linchpin as a
  *conditional* theorem via performative prediction (Perdomo 2020). Contraction `ε·β/γ<1` ⇒ unique
  performatively-stable `v*`. Key honest OPEN: **(C4) inner-equilibrium uniqueness** (the bilevel/
  Stackelberg coupling) = the genuinely-novel obligation; Hodge potential flagged as candidate potential
  function. The static guards shrink `ε` ⇒ they enter the (3) proof, not separate from it.
- **▶ NEXT:** `/critical-qa` both M1+M2 before whitepaper embedding · discharge (C4) (try monotone/
  potential-game on the inner sub-game) · M3 peer-prediction `p` (build) · M4 self-report collusion-eq
  (build+proof). Infra in parallel per below.

## ⭐ OFFICIAL TOP PRIORITY (Will 2026-06-23) — the Honest-Contribution Equilibrium on the Contribution Consensus Problem
*"you cannot have noesis if you dont have wills equilibrium on the contribution problem."* THE load-bearing
core; the solution-defining spine, above feature-builds. Critical path + honest per-property status + the
ONE linchpin (the adaptive-convergence theorem, M2) in **`internal/ROADMAP-WILLS-EQUILIBRIUM.md`**. Point
the research stack at M2 first (the only claim both unproven AND load-bearing for un-gameability). Memory:
`[[contribution-consensus-problem]]` · `[[wills-equilibrium]]`. Feature infra (finalization twin-update,
clawback, lock-sig go-live, deploy) continues in parallel but does NOT define whether the problem is solved.

## ⚑ COLLABORATORS (2026-06-18) — Pragma Research brought in
Will: "invite Tom lindeman and Bernhard to noesis private repo so they can help us."
- Tom Lindeman = `EtherDotBlue` (Runtime Verification Inc) — write-invite `322876564` PENDING.
- Bernhard Mueller = `muellerberndt` — write-invite `322876565` PENDING.
- Both verified against Will's GH following list (no impostor). Repo no longer solo ⇒ when onboarding,
  give them the lean-like-Bitcoin design constraint + the value-flow moat thread (the un-gameable v(S)).
- Check acceptance: `gh api repos/WGlynn/noesis/invitations`.

## 🔝 RESUME HERE (2026-06-23 ~10:45 — (tt): lock-script multi-input hardening + finalization twin-update DECIDED + cybernetics PAPER)
**This session also shipped:**
- **PAPER** `docs/cybernetics-economic-layer.tex` → 5pp PDF (pushed `50fa213`; Desktop
  `Noesis-Cybernetics-Economic-Layer-2026-06-23.pdf`). "Closing the Loop: Cybernetics at the Economic
  Layer." Thesis: economic cybernetics (Lange/Beer/Cybersyn) failed on the missing SENSOR, not control
  theory (Ashby Requisite-Variety + Conant-Ashby Good-Regulator both ⇒ measure-first; Hayek = sensing
  diagnosis). Noesis = the sensor; Good-Regulator applied reflexively ⇒ "semi-self-aware" is a THEOREM
  bounded by the measurement-horizon K; autopoiesis/immune-net for self-healing; autoimmunity = failure
  mode contained by K. Honest demonstrated-vs-designed. Memory `[[noesis-as-self-healing-immune-system]]`.
- **(tt) lock-script per-input hardening** — +2 multi-input tests on (ss): two different-key owners each
  sign their own input (both→0); a wrong-key signature on a LATER input can't smuggle past index 0 (→42).
  Proves the per-input authorization loop gates EVERY input. locksig 10→**12**, full suite 310→**312**.
- **(tt) finalization PROGRAM twin-update — DECIDED, build fresh.** Route `finalization-typescript` through
  `finalizes_pos_pom_fixed` ((oo)). NOT a 1-line swap: that fn hardcodes `FINALITY_MIX_Q` + `quorum_floor=0`
  + anti-concentration, so cell `mix` AND `quorum_floor` go VESTIGIAL ⇒ DECISION = DROP/ignore (ignored ⇒
  not attacker-choosable; wire format stable; SECURITY WIN: mix now consensus-constant). Real work = TEST
  RE-DERIVATION: `now_is_header_sourced` must be REDESIGNED (pos_pom removes the floor ⇒ `now` only flips
  via DIFFERENTIAL validator decay, not the floor) + ADD an anti-concentration fixture (PoM-whale/zero-PoS
  rejected). Full contract in ROADMAP (tt). **Build fresh low-context** (finality semantics = high care).

## 🔝 RESUME HERE (2026-06-23 ~10:00 — "continue building noesis per roadmap": on-VM LOCK SCRIPT BUILT (ss))
**(ss) the on-VM lock-script PROGRAM is BUILT ✅** — executed the (rr) build contract, the #1 on-VM
frontier. New crate `onchain/locksig-typescript` (no_std, riscv64imac; mirrors `finalization-typescript`):
one ELF that, INSIDE the VM, reconstructs the value-movement, recomputes the canonical `tx_digest` via
the single-sourced `noesis_core::tx` ((qq)), and verifies each input's PQ Lamport sig ((pp)) against the
cell's `lock.args` root — the on-VM twin of the node's (nn) `spend_is_authorized`, closing
existence→control at the VM layer. **Single-source codec added** to `noesis_core::tx`
(`OwnedCellView` + `encode_cell_identity`/`parse_cell_identity`, reusing the digest's `serialize_cell`
framing) so host and on-VM agree by construction. **10 tests through the ELF** (`node/tests/ckb_vm_locksig.rs`):
valid→0, wrong-key→42 (existence≠control, the anti-theater anchor — stub verify→true flips it RED,
confirmed), tampered→42, empty-auth→0 (inert), non-32B root→43, unknown standard→44, mixed-type→45,
malformed→41, empty group→41; DIGEST PARITY proven directly + end-to-end. Exit namespace 41-45. Siblings
green (finalization 6 / proven_e2e 10 / commit_order 8); node lib 249, full suite 300→310; 0 new clippy. Commit: see git tip.
Honest 🟡 deploy-coupled (same boundary as the finalization registry / commit-order coord bindings):
pre-deploy cell identity rides the served model record via `load_cell_data` (`CELL_FIELDS_BOUND` flips to
real CKB cell-field syscalls at deploy); `CONTROL_ENFORCED` inert (empty auth authorizes).

**▶ NEXT (BUILD fresh):** (1) finalization PROGRAM twin-update → `finalizes_pos_pom_fixed` ((oo)) — its
own small fork (cell `mix` vestigial under hardcoded `FINALITY_MIX_Q`: keep-and-assert vs drop). (2)
lock-sig GO-LIVE flip (`CONTROL_BINDING_ACTIVE` + `CONTROL_ENFORCED` true + populate `auths` across honest
flows + real-entropy keygen — a deploy step, breaks every empty-auth test until flows carry sigs). (3) 🔬
Winternitz/SPHINCS+ compression of the 16 KiB Lamport sig. (4) temporal-flow iterated-Shapley fixed-point
(🔬). (5) **learned-v(S) on real DeepFunding labels = THE moat (data-blocked).**

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-21 ~15:00 — WP v5.0 shipped: trim 17→13pp + full coherence/fact/tokenomics audit, committed `9a3f15e`)
**Whitepaper now v5.0** (master, pushed `9a3f15e`; PDF `~/Desktop/Noesis-Whitepaper-v5.0-2026-06-21-1455.pdf`, 13pp). This session: (1) **trim 17→13pp** typography-only (10pt, 0.7in margins, tight rhythm, 2-col refs, author footnote cut) — Will reverted the prose-compression, full argument preserved; (2) **coherence/fact/tokenomics audit, 16 fixes** — full findings `~/Desktop/noesis-whitepaper-audit-2026-06-21.md`. Headlines: Sztorc 2022→2015; **11 of 37 refs were orphans** (never cited) → all woven into the claim they back (CKB/PBFT/Casper/Minotaur/Flash Boys/Aumann/Bernheim/Gao/Perdomo/Christiano/Maynard Smith); the **PoW "zero-weight" vs "defeat-all-three" contradiction** resolved (halting vs value-capture); **"one PoM = one byte"** made precise (soulbound standing → right to mint a transferable byte); **franchise-decay separated from state-rent**; **"mint and burn balance"** → explicit fixed-point equilibrium; "Trinomial Stability System" reframed as Will's own coinage (was reading as external prior art); test count 286→289. **OPEN (whitepaper):** `docs/WHITEPAPER.md` plain-language markdown rewrite is uncommitted mid-stream (not mine; left untouched) — reconcile vs v5.0 or finish/delete; author's-note (Will-voice); `DESIGN-wills-equilibrium.md` rename; accessible-tier `docs/NOESIS-*.md` sweep vs v5.0.

**🔝 RESUME (2026-06-22 ~20:00 — "full auto finish roadmap": TWO increments landed + pushed):**
- **(ll) `unified_settlement` BUILT ✅** (the (kk) contract): wraps `unified_slash`, emits corrected
  `burned = Σ merged` with zero canceled/payout; mint↔sink + overlap-undercount tests, anti-theater RED on
  treating the overlap as disjoint. Commit `73a04fc`. ⚠ that commit ALSO swept the pre-existing uncommitted
  `docs/WHITEPAPER.md` plain-language prose rewrite + `docs/whitepaper/HANDOFF-readability-v1.5.md` (via a
  `git add -A` slip) — content legit, but conflated with the moat increment; NOT force-split (pushed +
  collaborators). The "WHITEPAPER.md left untouched" note above is now STALE: it is committed.
- **(mm) T3 finality-wiring DONE ✅** (LOCKED consensus-decision #3): live `runtime::finalizes` now routes
  through `finality::finalizes_pos_pom` (PoW out of finality + anti-concentration), was `finalizes_hybrid`
  with `c.mix`. Body-only, suite green, pinned by `live_finalizes_wrapper_routes_through_pos_pom`
  (anti-theater RED on revert). Parity caveat resolved: on-VM mirror still 🟡 designed ⇒ forward constraint.
  Commit `7662ce0`. lib 245, full suite **296 green**.
- **(nn) lock-sig PQ verifier LINKED ✅** (Will: "pq"): `runtime::lamport` — hash-based Lamport one-time
  signatures (no external crate; pubkey = 32-byte blake2b root = `lock.args`; one-time-safe for free via
  the single-use cell invariant). `spend_is_authorized` now verifies a presented `auth` FOR REAL against
  the finalized cell's `lock.args`; existence→CONTROL closed cryptographically (the (o) residual), pinned
  end-to-end through `node.validate` + anti-theater RED on stub. `CONTROL_BINDING_ACTIVE` still false (gates
  only empty-auth tolerance) so honest flows unchanged. keygen/sign are `cfg(test)` (a node only verifies).
  Commit `216b4ec`. lib 248, full suite **298 green**.
- **(oo) on-VM finalization mirror of (mm) BUILT ✅:** `noesis-core::finalizes_pos_pom_fixed` +
  `FINALITY_MIX_Q` + `MIN_DIM_BPS` + `dim_ok_q` — the live PoS+PoM rule in pure Q32.32, builds host AND
  riscv64imac, drift-guarded vs the f64 (mm) rule (conservative direction + anti-concentration), anti-theater
  RED on `dim_ok_q→true`. Closes the (mm) forward-parity: the live rule and its on-VM arithmetic are now one.
  Re-exported in node lib (single source). Commit `9de617f`. lib 300, full suite **300 green**. Remaining 🟡 =
  the on-VM PROGRAM (ELF calling it + header-`now` + fixtures).
- **(pp) on-VM PORT of the PQ lock-sig verifier BUILT ✅:** moved `lamport` (keygen/sign/verify) into
  `noesis-core::lamport` (no_std, builds riscv64imac) — single source for the on-VM lock-script + the node;
  node re-exports it, `verify_sig` + all (nn) tests reference it UNCHANGED (behavior-identical move = the
  regression proof). Duplicate node copy deleted (−86 lines). Commit `e211303`. Full suite **300 green**.
- **(qq) tx_digest serializer ported to noesis-core BUILT ✅:** `noesis_core::tx::{CellView, tx_digest}`
  (no_std, builds riscv) — the single-source debt `TokenTx::digest` flagged, paid. Node delegates;
  byte-identical (the spend/sign test is the regression proof). Commit `731d1fd`. Full suite **300 green**.
  With (pp), BOTH on-VM lock-script ingredients (verify arithmetic + tx_digest) are now single-sourced.
- **(rr) on-VM lock-script PROGRAM — DESIGN tick (build contract DECIDED):**
  `internal/DESIGN-onvm-locksig-program.md`. Resolves the TokenTx↔CKB-cell fork (every digest field from
  consensus state; `standard` derived from `type_script.code_hash` via a const map; `auth`=witness[i]).
  Build = glue over the ported (pp)/(qq) arithmetic. Pinned: 40s exit codes, `CONTROL_ENFORCED` sentinel,
  the digest-PARITY test, anti-theater. Doc-only; suite still 300.
- **▶ NEXT (BUILD this fresh):** `onchain/locksig-typescript` to the (rr) contract (mirror
  `finalization-typescript` + the `ckb_vm_*` host harness). THEN: finalization PROGRAM twin-update to
  `finalizes_pos_pom_fixed` ((oo)) — its own small design fork (cell `mix` vestigial under hardcoded
  `FINALITY_MIX_Q`) · lock-sig GO-LIVE flip (`CONTROL_BINDING_ACTIVE` + `CONTROL_ENFORCED`) · learned-v(S)
  = THE moat (data-blocked). (`CONTROL_BINDING_ACTIVE=true` + populate `auths` across
  honest token flows + real-entropy keygen — a deploy step, breaks every empty-auth test until flows carry
  sigs) · on-VM finalization mirror of the (mm) PoS+PoM rule (Q32.32/RISC-V, large fresh build) · on-VM
  lock-script port of `lamport::verify` · 🔬 Winternitz/SPHINCS+ compression of the 16 KiB one-time sig ·
  temporal-flow iterated-Shapley fixed-point (🔬) · **learned-v(S) on real DeepFunding labels = THE moat
  (data-blocked)**.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-21 ~10:00 — WP v4.0 shipped + moat gg/hh/ii + THE SOURCE WAR capstone opened)
**Whitepaper now v4.0** (master, pushed; PDF `~/Desktop/Noesis-Whitepaper-v4.0-2026-06-20-1653.pdf`, 17pp). Arc this session: v3.4 abstract reframe (lead-with-thesis, Bitcoin-grading cut) · v3.5 capstone line ("the explanation of how they hold together at once") · v3.6 refs 15→33 (2×) · v3.7 NEW §"Value at the margin" (marginal-revolution grounding, Jevons/Menger/Walras) · v3.8 bib web-verified (3 fixes: Minotaur authors, Sztorc 2015, Ergon 2021; +Jevons/Menger/Walras → 36 refs) · v3.9 CUT §15 economic-frame (redundant) keep value-at-margin · **v4.0 ELIMINATED the named "Glynn equilibrium" conjecture** (Will: ¬name-after-me).

**🔝 THE SOURCE WAR (next-session strategic lead):** Will — win at the SOURCE (substrate that absorbs state-corrective-fns into market-physics + perpetuates cooperative species-nature via multilevel-selection) ¬ SURFACE (one-off dapps). Canon `memory/primitive_source-war-over-surface-instances.md`. OPEN FORK: what IS "the source" — (1) un-extractable market-kernel · (2) unified value-substrate (ETM) · (3) propagation/selection-engine. My read: (3)∘((1)+(2)). **Awaiting Will: which-alive ∨ un-named.** Full session handoff: `memory/project_session-2026-06-21-noesis-whitepaper-source-war.md`.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-20 ~08:20 — PoW reframed honestly + 3 OPEN consensus-design decisions teed for fresh context)

**Shipped this morning (pushed, private):** accessible paper tier (For-Dummies / Litepaper / One-pager / FAQ + PAPERS index) in md+pdf+txt+html (`docs/`, `docs/dist/`), Desktop `noesis papers/` folder built (papers at top, 23 WP PDFs in `whitepaper versions/`). Whitepaper now **v3.2** (commit `befd2c2`). PoW REFRAMED across all docs per Will: NOT wasteful (we use it in consensus); PoW = Sybil/spam resistance via external cost (Sztorc 2022, "Nothing is Cheaper than PoW"); Noesis money layer = **proportional, Ergon-style energy-oracle money** (stable, spendable, hoarding-irrational); three layers as economic opposites (PoM scarce/inelastic/unbuyable decides; energy money elastic circulates; stake = stakeholders). ENTICE PoW advocates, don't dunk ("your ASICs still useful"). Useful-PoW (primes/protein) fell short = utility EXOGENOUS; PoM endogenous. Refs added: Sztorc 2022, Ergon (`ergon.moe/prop-reward.pdf`).

**🔝 NEXT SESSION (fresh low-context — these are MOAT CONSENSUS surgery, do cold; blast radius = the 60/30/10 mix + finalization tests + `realizable_log_share` capture proofs):**
1. **PoW dimension scaling: log₂ → PROPORTIONAL (Ergon).** Currently `consensus::log_weight` (`node/src/lib.rs:3073`, `(1+raw).log2()`) is applied to BOTH PoW and PoM dimensions (comment L3070); PoS linear. Will always wanted PoW **proportional like Ergon**. Read `ergon.moe/prop-reward.pdf` for the proportional-reward form first. The money-layer reward stub is also log-power → replace with proportional.
2. **DECIDED (Will 2026-06-20): REMOVE log₂ dampening wherever it is REDUNDANT.** Rationale: (a) capture is already handled structurally — mix 60/30/10 + 2/3 supermajority ⇒ buyable PoS+PoW=40% < 66.7% without the unbuyable PoM, and PoM's 60% < 66.7% means it can't solo-finalize regardless of log-vs-linear; so the log₂ extra margin is redundant; (b) **log₂ also dampens the asset's own value potential** — it caps how much a genuinely valuable contribution can be worth, suppressing exactly what the chain should reward. ⇒ **PoM → linear; PoW → proportional (Ergon).** Do NOT add new damping to PoS unless separately decided (capital is at-risk/slashable + bounded by needing unbuyable PoM for supermajority). **⚠ PREREQUISITE before editing — find where log₂ ACTUALLY fires:** `consensus::base_weight` (`node/src/lib.rs:2913`) and `effective_weight` (L2927) already use LINEAR raw (`v.pow*m.pow + v.pos*m.pos + v.pom*m.pom`). `log_weight` (L3073) appears only in `realizable_log_share*` ANALYSIS helpers (L3083/3093) + a test (L3298). So the live node weight path may ALREADY be linear, and the "NCI applies log₂" claim (comment L3070) likely refers to the on-chain NCI contract or a score-precompute, NOT the node. STEP 1 = locate the real application site (node score-calc vs NCI Solidity contract vs only-analysis); only then remove. Counter previously weighed + rejected by Will: the `realizable_log_share` capture-margin — Will judges it redundant + value-suppressing.
3. **Proof-of-spacetime as a 4th consensus axis?** Will: "only other distinct value dimension in crypto with a future"; "we did say consensus can have >3 axes." DISCUSS LATER (Will-deferred), but it composes with the scaling re-derivation.
4. **Candidate paper preamble (Will 2026-06-20):** "We hold these things to be true simultaneously" (Declaration echo). The thesis-difficulty IS the simultaneity — value measured-on-chain ∧ un-gameable; standing unbuyable ∧ decides-consensus; PoW used ∧ not-waste ∧ proportional-money; contribution fully-rewarded (no log₂ suppression) ∧ uncapturable; cooperative ∧ competitive ∧ convergent ∧ honest-by-construction. Every correction this session was defending the conjunction. Candidate opening frame for v3.x.

**Deferred crons this session (all recurring, next tick):** noesis-extraction-audit (NOT run — fired then Will redirected), substrate-sync (own-session false-positive), pom-roadmap-advance, telemetry-rotate, archive-reindex, afk-corpus-reweight, anthropic-campaign-watcher, odysseus-issue-help (interrupted).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-20 ~00:45 — WHITEPAPER v3.0 shipped: market-core, unification, Glynn equilibrium, plain-down)
**Pushed to v3.0** (`WGlynn/noesis` master `a6bb5db`; PDF `~/Desktop/Noesis-Whitepaper-v3.0-*.pdf`, 16pp). Full arc v1.5→v3.0 tonight, all Will-directed, all math/numbers byte-identical:
- **Conceptual core → market reframe (v2.6):** "the chain is the market that contribution never had; it prices contribution by realized downstream flow along provenance." Dissolves the measurement problem instead of resting on it. `v(S)` = the price; score/stake/consensus computed from it.
- **One unifying rule (v2.8):** §"Endogenous value" opens with "novel realized downstream flow along provenance"; the 4 anti-gaming defenses (novelty/saturation/HodgeRank/bounded-gate) reframed as its four faces. φ-decay marked as the rule's one free knob (defuses the numerology critique).
- **The Glynn equilibrium (v2.8):** honest NAMED CONJECTURE under §economic-frame — Nash + coalition-proof (demonstrated) + adaptive-stability (open, tied to performative-prediction). NAME is a PLACEHOLDER (Will riffed "equilibrium of will / Glynn equilibrium / something cool" — NOT locked). Spec: `internal/DESIGN-wills-equilibrium.md`.
- **§"How honesty propagates upward" (v2.8):** new plain section — honest DeFi by default; cooperation is the highest-paying move and compounds.
- **§"Three powers" rewrite (v2.9):** cognition leads + earns (franchise, unbuyable); compute+capital = value-inert LIVENESS FLOOR (produce/order blocks when no contribution; earn no PoM, can't touch value-history). Answers "what if nobody's contributing" + resolves the cognition-vs-capital tension.
- **Plain-down pass (v3.0):** de-jargoned the densest third (additivity/Myerson/HodgeRank/economic-frame/related-work). ~12–15%, NOT the full 20%.
- **Satoshi-voice/viral (v1.5–v2.x):** no Bitcoin diss; cryptoeconomics = mint the missing medium; anchors "you can buy storage, you cannot buy consensus" + "come compete → come join us".

**ALSO (2026-06-20 morning, full-auto — accessible paper tier):** shipped **For-Dummies / Litepaper / One-pager / FAQ** + `PAPERS.md` reading-map off v3.0 (`docs/NOESIS-*.md`), each rendered to **PDF + TXT + HTML** in `docs/dist/` (pandoc + md-to-pdf skill; mermaid stripped from the for-dummies exports). Pushed `5d70443`. Built Desktop folder **`noesis papers/`** (4 papers at top level; all 23 whitepaper-version PDFs moved into `whitepaper versions/`; Desktop decluttered). **Yellowpaper dropped** per Will (no rigorous spec needed now). Deferred overnight crons still pending (all recurring, will catch next tick): substrate-sync (defers on own-session background-task false-positive — logged in `~/.claude/cron-prompts/_primitives-pending.md`), pom-roadmap-advance, telemetry-rotate, archive-reindex, afk-corpus-reweight, story-mode-self-improve, anthropic-campaign-watcher.

**🔝 NEXT SESSION (fresh head):**
1. **Formalize the Glynn equilibrium** — definition + conditional existence (or keep labeled conjecture), cite performative-prediction / coalition-proof-NE / ESS, run `/critical-qa`. **Lock the name with Will first.**
2. **Finish the 20% plain-down** — the 4 untouched dense sections: Privacy, Security/threat-model, Consensus finalization, the living-mechanism 6-item list.
3. **Simplicity structural pass** — move core/nucleolus + hybrid-finalization math to an appendix; keep the spine to ~5 ideas.
4. **Length:** 16pp vs ≤12pp target — tighten.
5. **Loose end:** stale `docs/WHITEPAPER.md` (old v0.1 markdown, orphaned edits) — revert/delete so it stops competing with the .tex.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-19 evening — WHITEPAPER viral/Satoshi reframe v1.5→v2.5; + Will's Equilibrium QUEUED as next-session #1)
- **🔝 NEXT SESSION #1 (Will: "YESSSSSS this", 2026-06-19):** formalize **Will's Equilibrium** as its own short section under §"The economic frame." Do it FRESH low-context and run `/critical-qa`. Full spec + grounded definition + proof obligations + honest positioning in `internal/DESIGN-wills-equilibrium.md`. **Honest discipline (load-bearing):** goes in as a *named result* ONLY if at least a conditional existence statement is defensible; otherwise as an openly-labeled *named conjecture*. The novel core = an equilibrium that is (1) Nash + (2) coalition-proof (collusion zeroed by the provenance geometry, demonstrated via (q)–(bb)) + (3) **stable under an adaptive adversary because the value-measure retrains** (the formal statement of "fixed formula → gamed; adaptive measure → un-gameable"; DESIGNED-not-demonstrated, data-blocked on the learned-v(S) moat). Cite performative-prediction / coalition-proof-NE / ESS as lineage; claim only the fusion. Mark demonstrated-vs-designed per component.
- **Tonight's whitepaper work (Will live, viral pass):** reframed the abstract to LEAD with the two grounded whole-system claims — (a) cooperative economics by construction (anchor: "you can buy storage; you cannot buy consensus") and (b) convergence-not-competition / reverse fork (anchor: "the offer stops being come compete and becomes come join us", echoed in §Forwards-compatibility). Satoshi voice: NO diss of Bitcoin (it solved possession; it minted the medium for trustless ownership), unifying thesis = **cryptoeconomics brings a market into being by minting the medium it was missing** (Bitcoin→possession, Noesis→contribution; bookended in the conclusion). De-narrated per Will ("no narrative stuff, this isn't the MCU"): killed "mastery of a new fire / engines and rockets", killed every "wasted energy". Added a Nash-equilibrium line in §economic frame (upgrade-to-Will's-Equilibrium next session). Honesty markers kept (cross-chain merge = designed-not-built). Versions: v2.4 pushed `6be7e94`; v2.5 (de-narration) committed this session. PDF: `~/Desktop/Noesis-Whitepaper-v2.5-*.pdf`.
- **Open loose ends:** (1) stale `docs/WHITEPAPER.md` (old v0.1 markdown, orphaned edits) — revert/delete so it stops competing with the .tex; (2) whitepaper is **15pp**, target ≤12 — a prose-tightening pass is owed (the reframes added length).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-19 (bb) — BUILT ✅ the (aa) collusion ring is now DETECTED: `attribution_circulation` alarm; lib 234, suite 285)
- **Shipped the moat-INDEPENDENT first-order alarm** executing (aa)'s named next step. `attribution_circulation(cells) -> u64` (node/src/lib.rs, near `pom_scores`): cross-identity edge `builder→cited` when a block's parent is owned by another identity; circulation = `Σ_{pairs} min(flow[i→j],flow[j→i])` = the bidirectional/2-cycle component, provably 0 for one-way patterns. TESTED: honest DAG=0, (aa) K=3 ring=3=C(3,2), break-on-purpose drop-one-back-edge→2. lib 234, suite 285, 0 new clippy. NO real-label data needed — topology alone converts the (aa) ring undetected→detected.
- **Residual 🔬 (honest):** catches MUTUAL (2-cycle) collusion; a directed k-cycle (1→2→3→1, no back-edges) evades it — needs the full Helmholtz–Hodge harmonic component (value-certificate, designed-not-built). This is its KERNEL.
- **NEXT:** (1) wire `attribution_circulation` into the dispute/slash gate (detection → economic penalty) — the move that makes it bite; (2) upgrade to full Hodge harmonic residual (catches directed k-cycles) ⇒ then flip the (aa) pin to a saturation bound. Also: lock-sig DEPLOY half · on-VM single-use (k) · learned-v(S) moat.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-19 (aa) — BUILT ✅ named + DEMONSTRATED an OPEN vector: collusion-ring / mutual-citation 🔬; lib 233, suite 284)
- **NEW OPEN VECTOR, pinned RED-as-designed.** Adversary at (z)'s land-moment: (z) showed a root needs EXTERNAL downstream to earn ⇒ K colluders MANUFACTURE it by cross-building novel children on each other's roots. **MEASURED** (`collusion_ring_mutual_citation_probe`): orphan/member=0 (z), honest single=16.44, ring/member = 22.98→27.71→29.10 (K2→K4) ⇒ EXCEEDS honest single AND rises with K. Structural v(S) proxy credits valueless-but-novel cross-citation as real built-upon flow = the load-bearing open problem made concrete. lib 233, suite 284, 0 new clippy.
- **TWO closure paths:** (1) **STRUCTURAL, moat-INDEPENDENT** — a ring is a CYCLE ⇒ HodgeRank harmonic-energy residual (paper §"Certifying the value") is the exact alarm; wiring it as a stake-slash gate needs NO real-label data. (2) MOAT — learned-v(S)-on-real-labels scores the noise low (data-blocked). Pin asserts pump EXISTS; flips RED when either closure lands.
- **NEXT (highest-leverage, moat-independent):** wire the HodgeRank harmonic-energy alarm against the collusion ring — first adversarial vector with a structural fix that does NOT wait on real-label data. Then: lock-sig DEPLOY half (`verify_sig`+sig-suite, deploy-coupled) · on-VM single-use (k) · learned-v(S) moat.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-19 (z) — BUILT ✅ named + CLOSED a new gaming vector: orphan-root / multi-parent fan-out; lib 232, suite 283)
- **NEW VECTOR named + closed by TEST, no new mechanism.** AdversarialLayeringSelfNamesNextLayer on the (u) joint-decay fix: every volume-damping axis so far (within-identity λ^r · cross-identity μ^m · joint ρ^j) operates on a PARENT'S CHILDREN; disconnected ROOTS (`parent=None`) escape all of them. Attack = post K distinct novel roots instead of K children of one root. **Defense = the realized-downstream-flow gate** (a root nobody builds on has no realized flow ⇒ seeds 0). **MEASURED** (`orphan_roots_are_realized_flow_gated_no_fan_out_pump`, value::tests): built-upon root (4 external-identity children) = **17.6623**; K orphan roots, no children = **0.0000 ∀ K∈{1,2,4,8}** ⇒ K×0=0, pump closed at source. Anti-theater intrinsic: same harness pays 17.66 for built vs 0 for orphans (the positive reference IS the control — no separate mutation needed). lib 231→232, suite 282→283, 0 new clippy. Honest scope: closes orphan-as-FREE-standing; an orphan genuinely built upon earns legitimately (intended, not the attack).
- **NEXT:** lock-sig DEPLOY half (`verify_sig(owner=input.lock.args, msg=tx_digest, sig=auth)` + sig-suite ed25519/PQ; deploy-coupled, fresh low-context; anti-theater: always-true verify ⇒ control regression RED) · on-VM single-use (k) · learned-v(S)-on-real-labels (THE moat).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-19 (y) — BUILT ✅ lock-sig step-3: `spend_is_authorized` WIRED into the spend path, inert; lib 231, suite 282)
- **BUILT — the existence→control gate is now LIVE in validation, sentinel-inert.** Added `auths: Vec<Vec<u8>>` to `TokenTx` (one field, per-input, positionally aligned with `inputs`; carried ON the tx because the sig is committed content every validator re-checks). `is_valid_in_ledger` now: existence + `is_valid` first, then computes `self.digest()` once and calls `spend_is_authorized(input, auths[i] or &[] if short, &tx_digest)` for every input. SHORT/EMPTY `auths` ⇒ all inputs get the empty sentinel ⇒ inert ⇒ **every honest flow unchanged**; a PRESENTED non-empty `auth` ⇒ rejected (unverifiable pre-deploy) ⇒ gate live, not dead code. Dropped both `#[allow(dead_code)]` on `digest`+`spend_is_authorized` (now consumed by the live path). 19 test literals got `auths: vec![]` via a one-pass script (insert after each `standard:` line — free field-order, no brace-matching).
- **+1 regression `ledger_spend_path_consults_authorization_gate`** — proves the gate fires THROUGH `node.validate` (not just the isolated unit test): sentinel-auth honest spend validates, same spend with a presented `[9,9,9]` auth is rejected. **break-on-purpose:** rubber-stamp the inert path (`true`) ⇒ regression RED; revert ⇒ green. Not theater. **0 new clippy** (hits at runtime.rs 37/38/102/279 all pre-existing, outside changed regions).
- **NEXT grain = DEPLOY (coupled, fresh low-context):** flip `CONTROL_BINDING_ACTIVE=true`, body → `verify_sig(owner=input.lock.args, msg=tx_digest, sig=auth)`, link a sig-suite (ed25519 fast-path + PQ; `auth` is suite-agnostic opaque bytes). Anti-theater: an always-true `verify_sig` ⇒ the control regression must go RED. Per `DESIGN-locksig-binding.md` step 3 (deploy half) + ROADMAP (v). Then on-VM single-use (k) · learned-v(S)-on-real-labels (THE moat).
- **PAPER synced (Code↔Text loop):** threat-model row "spend another owner's cell" `designed (digest built)` → `designed (call-site wired, inert)`; test count 281→282; demonstrated-vs-designed §Security refined. PDF recompiled 14pp clean. + 3 legibility glosses earlier (Myerson/HodgeRank/finalization) — see EVOLUTION-LOG Draft 1.2 (legibility rev).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-19 (x) — BUILT ✅ lock-sig step-2 inert shape (pom-roadmap-advance); lib 230, suite 281)
- **BUILT `TokenTx::spend_is_authorized(input, auth, tx_digest)`** (`node/src/runtime.rs`) — the existence→control SHAPE, the deploy-independent grain after (w)'s `tx_digest`. Sentinel-gated INERT: empty `auth` ⇒ authorized (honest pre-deploy path, all flows unchanged); presented non-empty `auth` ⇒ REJECTED (no verifier yet ⇒ unverifiable sig ≠ authorization ⇒ gate LIVE not dead code). Explicit `CONTROL_BINDING_ACTIVE=false` flag (¬ overloaded sentinel, QA-port-2); deploy branch `unreachable!`s ⇒ flipping the flag w/o wiring `verify_sig` FAILS LOUD. Owner = FINALIZED cell's `lock.args` (consensus-derived, ¬ producer-asserted). +1 test, lib 229→230, suite 280→281, 0 new clippy. **Honest fix:** `#[allow(dead_code)]` on `digest` + `spend_is_authorized` (deploy-scaffolding, tested) — the (w) commit's "0 new clippy" was test-build-only and had missed `digest`'s lib-build dead_code warning; corrected here.
- **NEXT grain (fresh low-context — touches the spend path):** wire `spend_is_authorized` INTO `is_valid_in_ledger` — add an `auth` per input on `TokenTx` (ripples to TokenTx constructors), thread it through, sentinel ⇒ green. Then DEPLOY: flip `CONTROL_BINDING_ACTIVE`, body → `verify_sig(lock.args, tx_digest, auth)`, break-on-purpose (always-true verify ⇒ control regression RED). Per `DESIGN-locksig-binding.md` step 3 + ROADMAP (v) build contract.
- **Strategy threads this session (Will live):** foundational WHITEPAPER shipped (Draft 1.0 PDF, `docs/whitepaper/`, + Desktop copy for his dad); CKBased.bit first reaction logged (FB-001, EVOLUTION-LOG → Draft 1.1 "living-measurement" section); novelty audit RI-001 (`docs/research/RELATED-WORK-NOVELTY-AUDIT-2026-06-19.md` — claim (a) NOVEL, Bittensor precise, b/d/e need a 2nd pass vs Deep Funding/Data-Shapley/SBT/HodgeRank/decentralized-training); CONVERGENCE-REVERSE-FORK thesis (`docs/CONVERGENCE-REVERSE-FORK.md` — un-fracture the economy structurally not by policy; VibeSwap SupplyAccountant/CanonicalToken/fractal-fork substrate-port). **Open fork awaiting Will:** 2nd research pass → WP v1.1 → convergence adapter build. `/marginal-contribution` skill shipped (writing-side twin of /critical-qa). Extraction-audit cron still PAUSED mid-checklist.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-19 (w) — BUILT ✅ tx_digest grain + SHIPPED the foundational WHITEPAPER (Will directive); lib 229/229, suite 280)
- **(1) BUILT the (v)-designed canonical `tx_digest` serializer** (pushed `78aedfa`). `TokenTx::digest()` in `node/src/runtime.rs` — the deterministic bytes a future owner-signature covers, the deploy-independent grain of the lock-sig existence→control mile. Canonicalizes input/output order by the LEDGER cell-identity tuple `(id,lock,type_script,data)` single-sourced with `is_valid_in_ledger`; length-prefixes every variable field (injective, `put`); domain-separated blake2b `personal(b"noesis-tx-v1\0\0\0\0")` so a tx digest can never alias an smt node hash. **parent/timestamp EXCLUDED by design** (not part of spend-identity; documented as invariant, not oversight — caught the build-contract's stale 4-field Cell view via grounding). `pub(crate)`, SINGLE-SOURCE-DEBT note to move to noesis-core at the on-VM port. +4 tests (deterministic / presentation-invariant / changes-iff-value / no-field-boundary-collision; boundary test pins length-prefixing as the assertion-form of break-on-purpose). lib 225→229, suite 280, 0 new clippy.
- **(2) SHIPPED THE FOUNDATIONAL WHITEPAPER** (Will 2026-06-19: *"THE foundational artifact for noesis, just like the btc wp was for btc … scientific with charts and equations"*; for his dad to read this weekend). `docs/whitepaper/noesis-whitepaper.tex` → **9-page PDF via MiKTeX pdflatex** (clean, 0 errors). Bitcoin-WP cadence: abstract + 11 numbered sections + refs. Real equations (BT/RLHF reward loss, additivity-collapse claim, Myerson on the provenance DAG, temporal novelty `ν(b)`, multiplicative bounded value-gate seed, geometric saturation bound `φ²≈2.618`, **Helmholtz-Hodge residual-as-manipulation-certificate**, hybrid finalization basis `max(W_eff,Q)`, PoM=Σ Myerson, 1 PoM=1 byte). 4 tikz/pgfplots figures — **two driven by REAL measured node data**: coordinated-volume saturation grid (diagonal-pump before/after the (u) joint-decay fix) + held-out learned-v(S) vs coverage-proxy ranking accuracy (≥0.9 vs 0.5). Honest demonstrated-vs-designed §9 (280 tests). Committed `10402c4`. **PDF copy on Desktop: `~/Desktop/Noesis-Whitepaper-ProofOfMind-2026-06.pdf`.**
- **NOTE for next session:** no rasterizer on box (`pdftoppm`/`gs`/`magick` absent) ⇒ PDF figures NOT visually verified, only compile-verified (pgfplots/tikz errors are fatal, none fired). If polishing, install a rasterizer or open the PDF to eyeball the two charts. Whitepaper is Draft 1.0 — `complete = ready-for-critique`; Will/Pragma review is the next loop. Candidate: feed it to Tom/Bernhard once they accept the repo invite.
- **NEXT frontier (unchanged):** lock-sig binding step 2 (inert sentinel-gated `spend_is_authorized(input, tx_digest)` call-site per `DESIGN-locksig-binding.md`) · on-VM single-use per (k) · learned-v(S)-on-real-labels (THE moat).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-19 (u) — BUILT ✅ T3 CLOSED: hybrid-split diagonal pump closed via single joint geometric decay; lib 225/225)
- **What shipped:** the T3 hybrid-split diagonal pump is CLOSED. The (q)/(r) two-axis fix (λ^r within-identity × μ^m cross-identity) bounded each axis alone but the cross MULTIPLIED (≈6.85·flow). Replaced the product-of-two-tails with a **single JOINT geometric decay ρ^j (ρ=1/φ)** over the GLOBAL flattened canonical order of a parent's external children. One tail, not a product.
- **Exact change (1 file, `node/src/lib.rs`, +101/−110):**
  - `flow::value_flow_with_own` (f64, ~L2426): deleted the `groups` build + within-identity λ^r loop + cross-identity μ^m sort/loop. Now: flatten `kids` into `ranked: Vec<(flow, args, child_idx)>`, sort by (flow desc, args asc, child_idx asc), sum `Σ_j ρ^j · contrib`. `const RHO = 1/φ`.
  - `settlement_fixed::value_flow_external_q32` (Q32.32 mirror, ~L6654): same flatten+single-tail; weight accumulated `w = mul(w, RHO_Q32)` per rank (RHO_Q32 = round(2^32/φ) = 2_654_435_769). Drift-guard (T6 + `v7_q32_tracks_f64_v7`) holds within 1e-6.
  - Determinism: child-index final tiebreak ⇒ total order even when flow AND args tie ⇒ no HashMap-iteration leak (T5 ×32 bit-identical).
- **HONEST GRID before→after** (v8(root), single-id K1×M8 bound 18.1073→18.1339): K2×M2 **18.18→17.66**, K4×M4 **19.75→18.20** (+0.34% over bound, ≤ ε=1.02). +9% pump gone; whole K×M grid (K,M∈{1,2,4}) ≤ bound×1.02.
- **Test flipped:** `..._pumps_past_single_identity_bound_open_gap` → `t3_hybrid_diagonal_saturates_under_joint_decay` (asserts whole grid bounded + honest K1M1 still paid).
- **Honest INERT:** T4/T5/T6 green; all honest v5–v8 green; v7_q32 drift-guard green. K=1 honest column ~unchanged (M4 17.6582→17.6623, 0.02% from flow-sorting the single-id column).
- **BREAK-ON-PURPOSE:** ρ:=1.0 → diagonal reopens (K4M4=21.22 > 20.57×1.02), **T3 RED**; reverted, 225/225.
- **clippy 0 NEW** (53→53 node warnings; 4 noesis-core errors pre-existing, untouched). **fmt:** my lines fmt-clean (no tree-wide run).
- **NEXT frontier:** lock-sig binding (existence→control) · on-VM single-use per (k) · learned-v(S)-on-real-labels (THE moat).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-18 (t) — BUILT the (s) 6-row matrix; T3 KEYSTONE FOUND A NEW VECTOR; lib 221→225)
- **The (s) acceptance matrix is built and T3 found a real gap.** Added the 6-row adversarial matrix vs the (r) cross-identity μ^m fix. **T1/T2 reuse** the existing flipped gap test (`multi_identity_split_volume_saturates_under_cross_identity_damping`); **T3/T4/T5** new in the `value` test module (~line 1818+), **T6** in `settlement_fixed` (~line 6860+). Shared `HYBRID_PAYLOADS` (16 dissimilar valueless prose) in both modules; helpers `t3_hybrid_order`/`t3_hybrid_standing`. cargo test --lib **225/225**.
- **🔬 T3 VERDICT: THE DIAGONAL PUMPS — new gaming vector `hybrid-split diagonal pump` (cross-axis geometric-tail compounding).** Each axis is bounded alone (λ^r within-identity, μ^m cross-identity) but their CROSS is not: K vested identities EACH posting M children give every K-group a full λ^r tail (≈2.618·flow), then those K near-saturated groups sum under the μ^m tail ⇒ the two tails MULTIPLY: bound_diagonal → flow·[1/(1−λ)]·[1/(1−μ)] ≈ 6.85·flow vs the single-identity bound 2.618·flow.
- **HONEST GRID** (measured, μ=λ=1/φ; v8(root); single-identity K1×M8 bound = **18.1073**):
  | K\M | M=1 | M=2 | M=4 |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | K=1 | 14.2821 | 16.4373 | 17.6582 |
  | K=2 | 16.4373 | **18.1768** | 19.0835 |
  | K=4 | 17.6623 | 19.0838 | **19.7499** |
  K2×M2=18.18 already breaks 18.11; K4×M4=19.75 ≈ +9%. Modest at the 8-identity standing-floor cost, but REAL + MONOTONE in K and M. Pinned RED-as-designed by `t3_hybrid_diagonal_pumps_past_single_identity_bound_open_gap`. **Tier 🔬 OPEN.**
- **FIX DESIGN (next, fresh low-context — production flow-path change, highest blast radius):** the pump is the PRODUCT of two per-axis tails ⇒ needs a JOINT bound, not two separate ones. Candidate A: fold each identity's within-identity rank-depth (group magnitude) back into the μ^m ordering so a deeply-stacked identity does not ALSO get near-full μ weight. Candidate B (cleaner): apply a SINGLE geometric decay over the GLOBAL flattened (identity, child-rank) order — one tail, not a product — collapsing 6.85·flow → ~2.618·flow. T3 is fix-agnostic: it asserts the pump today; when the joint-bound fix lands, FLIP it to `..._saturates` (assert K4×M4 ≤ bound×(1+ε)).
- **T4 ✅** honest INERT (2 honest identities on distinct real parents → both paid, μ^0=1 each). **T5 ✅** determinism: T1(K8)+T3(K4×M4) re-evaluated ×32 bit-identical (no HashMap leak). HONEST SCOPE: T5 pins RUN-TO-RUN/replica determinism on FIXED input, NOT input-shuffle invariance — commit order is a real value input (temporal_novelty + λ^r rank), shuffling legitimately changes value (17.66→17.75 under child reversal). **T6 ✅** Q32 parity: f64 `value_v7` ↔ `value_v7_q32` on T1 + T3 graphs within 1e-6 (parity at the FLOW layer where damping lives; v8 outcome gate is f64-only, no fixed port).
- **BREAK-ON-PURPOSE (anti-theater):** μ:=1.0 → SATURATION test + T6 went RED (μ load-bearing for both saturation AND f64↔fixed parity); μ:=0.05 → pump vanished (K2M2=16.63<18.11) and **T3 went RED** (T3 genuinely detects the pump). Reverted to μ=1/φ; 225/225.
- **clippy:** 0 NEW (the 4 pre-existing `noesis-core` is_multiple_of/div_ceil errors remain; my lines clean). **fmt:** my added lines follow the SAME compact-call style as the surrounding committed tests (which carry the repo's known rustfmt drift) — no tree-wide fmt, no NEW divergence.
- **NEXT frontier:** the T3 joint-bound fix (production flow-path, fresh low-context) — THEN lock-sig binding (existence→control) · on-VM single-use per (k) · the learned-v(S)-on-real-labels mile (THE moat).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-18 (r) — BUILT ✅ CLOSED: multi-identity-split gaming vector closed via cross-identity μ^m damping; lib 221/221, pushed `5a84c4a`)
- **BUILT — Opt B (geometric, symmetric to λ^r).** Within a parent: group each certifying identity's within-identity-damped (λ^r) contribution, SORT distinct identities by grouped contribution DESC (identity `type_script.args` ASC as canonical tiebreak), weight the m-th identity by μ^m (μ=λ=1/φ). One identity stays full (μ^0=1); additional identities decay ⇒ splitting volume across K vested identities saturates exactly like stacking under one. Both layers: f64 `flow::value_flow_with_own` (~2223) + Q32.32 mirror `settlement_fixed::value_flow_external_q32` (~6447, `MU_Q32 = round(2^32/φ) = 2_654_435_769`).
- **Why B not A:** the oracles preferred B — it closed the gap with the SMALLEST blast radius (honest 1-2-certifier cases inert: ranks m=0/1 ⇒ μ^0=1, μ^1 on the smaller contributor only ⇒ near-full) and kept every honest v5–v8 + the `v7_q32_tracks_f64` drift-guard green. A (hard cap via `max_certifying_identities`) was the sharper fallback but risks over-punishing legitimately broad certification; B already saturates so A was unneeded.
- **HONEST CURVE (multi-identity v8, root):** before K1=14.28 K2=17.26 K4=19.33 K8=20.57 (past the 18.11 single-id bound) → after K1=14.28 K2=16.44 K4=17.66 **K8=18.13** ⇒ SATURATES at the single-identity bound (18.11). RESIDUAL: bounds ¬ zeros — K8 ≈ K1 +27% (the same geometric μ^m tail the within-identity λ^r fix has; acceptable, the curve now mirrors single-identity saturation one level up). Honest v5–v8 unchanged; two_node/gaming/byzantine/core_drift_guard all green.
- **Test flipped + renamed:** `multi_identity_split_volume_defeats_per_identity_damping_open_gap` → `multi_identity_split_volume_saturates_under_cross_identity_damping` (asserts saturation + bounded ≤ single-identity bound + not-over-damped). Break-on-purpose verified: forcing μ^m inert (m→0) reverts the curve to K8=20.57 and reds the test ⇒ not theater.
- **CAVEAT (lean/fmt):** repo has pre-existing tree-wide rustfmt drift (committed under an older rustfmt; current toolchain disagrees ~200 hunks across lib.rs untouched by this change). Did NOT run tree-wide `cargo fmt` (would bury the moat change in 2k lines of unrelated churn); MY added lines verified fmt-clean via `cargo fmt --check` (no diff in the new blocks). Clippy: 4 pre-existing `noesis-core` errors (`is_multiple_of`/`div_ceil`, newer-clippy lints, outside changed lines) confirmed present on clean HEAD — 0 NEW. Both are standing repo-hygiene debts (a future tree-wide fmt + clippy-fix pass), orthogonal to this fix.
- **NEXT frontiers (intact):** lock-sig binding (existence→control) · on-VM single-use per (k). Then the learned-v(S)-on-real-labels mile (THE moat).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-18 (q) — BUILT ✅: (n) gaming vector CLOSED; per-identity λ^r flow damping live both layers; 220/220)
- Implemented the (p) design in `flow::value_flow_with_own` (f64) + `value_flow_external_q32` (Q32.32 mirror, LAMBDA_Q32=2654435769=round(2^32/φ)). r-th child of a parent from a given certifying identity weighted λ^r, λ=1/φ; single in-order pass ⇒ deterministic. Distinct identities full-weight @ rank 0 (honest cases INERT).
- Honest result: v8 N=1/2/4/8 = 14.28/16.44/17.66/18.11 ⇒ SATURATES. RESIDUAL: bounds ¬ zeros (8 dampened ≈ 1 undampened +2.7%); acceptable (v6 already standing-gates seeds, v8 dampens each). drift-guard `v7_q32_tracks_f64_v7` holds.
- Test `..._open_gap` → `single_identity_volume_saturates_under_per_identity_damping` (assertions flipped to saturation+bounded). Full suite 220/220. NOT yet committed/pushed at time of writing — see git status.
- **NEXT open (deploy-independent):** lock-sig binding (existence→control) · on-VM single-use per (k). Then the learned-v(S)-on-real-labels mile (THE moat).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-17 (p) — DESIGN: per-identity flow-normalization decided; closes the (n) gaming vector; node unchanged)
- **DESIGN tick (no code; PCP-gate — 3rd moat tick this session @ ~415k context in an unrelated
  OPH-marathon; `value_flow_with_own` feeds v5–v8 = highest blast radius ⇒ build in fresh low-context).**
- **DECISION:** group a parent's external children by certifying identity g (`type_script.args`), sort
  by commit order, weight r-th child by ω_r=λ^r (geometric). Parent flow = Σ_g Σ_r λ^r·flow[child_{g,r}].
  Volume attack: linear-in-N → geometric ≤ flow/(1−λ) (saturates, ¬ amplifies). Distinct identities full-
  weight @ rank 0 (honest diverse-cert untouched, orthogonal to `max_certifying_identities`). Deterministic
  (canonical sort ⇒ replicas converge). λ=1/φ candidate (FibonacciScaling). first-commit-wins = harder alt.
- **NEXT BUILD (scoped, fresh context):** (1) replace flat `Σ flow[k]` in `value_flow_with_own` with the
  per-identity λ^r sum; (2) FLIP `single_identity_volume_defeats_v8_dampening_open_gap` to closed (assert
  v8(8)≈v8(1), v8(4)≤v7(1)); (3) ALL honest v5–v8 stay green (distinct-id/single-child lineages ⇒ damping
  INERT ⇒ small blast radius, but VERIFY no cascade + two_node/gaming/byzantine); (4) honest-number any shift.
- Other open: lock-sig binding (existence→control) · on-VM single-use per (k). pushed (master, WGlynn/noesis).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-17 (o) — critical-qa CLOSED a value-forgery hole in the token layer; lib 219→220)
- **BUILT ✅ — found + fixed via /critical-qa on (m).** `is_valid_in_ledger` bound input existence to
  `(id, lock, type_script)` but NOT `data` (the amount), and conservation trusts the producer's input
  amount ⇒ an attacker owning ONE live cell could spend an INFLATED amount (reproduced: owned 6, spent
  1000). FIX = bind `data` too (one line). Regression `existence_binds_amount_no_value_forgery_from_an_inflated_input`
  (forgery rejected ∧ honest spend still validates). lib 219→220; integration green; 0 new clippy.
- **Pre-existing, not a (m) regression** — but (m) made value movement real so it mattered. Orthogonal
  residual unchanged: spending ANOTHER owner's real cell = the deploy-coupled lock-sig gap (existence ≠ control).
- **Open frontiers (next builds, fresh context):** (1) the (n) gaming vector — per-identity flow
  normalization in `value_flow_with_own`; (2) lock-sig binding (existence→control); (3) on-VM single-use
  per (k). Plus the standing method note: ∀ formatter-run ⇒ `git diff --stat` BEFORE commit.
- pushed (master, WGlynn/noesis) — see git log tip.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-17 (n) — RSAW: NEW v(S) gaming vector pinned — per-identity volume defeats v8 dampening; lib 218→219)
- **BUILT (adversarial-gaming loop) — found + pinned a new vector, grounded + measured.** `value_v8`
  dampens ONE valueless child, but `flow::value_flow_with_own` sums a parent's children flow with NO
  per-identity cap ⇒ a SINGLE vested attacker identity posting N distinct novel-but-valueless children
  saturates the root's flow gate; dampening is a constant factor bought off in N. Measured: root 14.28
  (N=1)→19.33 (N=4)→20.57 (N=8); v8(4)=19.33 > v7(1)=17.63 (full undampened single-child pump). Test
  `single_identity_volume_defeats_v8_dampening_open_gap`. lib 218→219; 0 new clippy.
- **Why a PIN not a patch:** PCP-gate (2nd delicate moat tick this session, growing context) — an
  additive open_gap regression test is low-risk; flow-layer surgery belongs in a fresh low-context window.
- **NEXT BUILD (fresh context):** PER-IDENTITY flow-contribution normalization in `value_flow_with_own` —
  the analog of `max_certifying_identities` one level down: cap / diminish a single identity's SUMMED
  certifying flow into one parent (e.g. normalize each parent's child-flow by distinct certifying
  identity, or apply diminishing returns past the first child per identity), then make the open_gap test
  flip to closed. Label-free + structural (NOT the DeepFunding-label-bound structured-valueless closure).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-17 (m) — BUILT: token-state persistence shipped; node lib 215→218; multi-hop A→B→C live)
- **BUILT ✅ — the (l) decision, shipped + tested.** `Ledger` now has a SEPARATE `token_cells` value-UTXO
  set; `is_valid_in_ledger` resolves token inputs against it; `apply` retires consumed inputs from AND
  persists `tx.outputs` to it (the missing append); `cells`/index/`pom_scores` stay token-blind;
  `state_digest` extended to a 4-tuple (token-cell ids) for token-state convergence. node lib **215→218**
  (+3: `multi_hop_token_flow_across_blocks`, `output_is_unspendable_until_its_producing_block_is_applied`,
  `token_movement_leaves_attribution_unchanged`); two_node/gaming/byzantine green; 0 new clippy (27 pre-existing).
- **HONEST SCOPE:** reference (in-memory) token ledger. Within-block output chaining out of scope in v1
  (validation snapshots the pre-block set). The on-VM port is now UNBLOCKED.
- **NEXT BUILD:** ON-VM single-use enforcement per (k) — committed-UTXO-set membership (SMT proof of each
  input's `(id+lock+type_script)` vs the live-UTXO-set root in a cell-dep) + rolling-root retirement
  (spent input deleted in the output state-root transition, mirroring `index_rule::valid_root_transition`).
  Deploy-coupled / sentinel-gated inert pre-deploy. Alternatively genesis/chain-spec (#1). Will-gated: T1 transport.
- pushed (master, WGlynn/noesis) — see git log tip below.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-17 (l) — DESIGN: token-state persistence DECIDED; (k) crate-question dissolved; node unchanged)
- **DESIGN tick (no code; PCP-gate — fresh session @ ~250k after an unrelated heavy build hour).** Advances the
  (k)-pinned PREREQUISITE (#4-next token-state persistence) named→DECIDED.
- **GROUNDED FINDING:** `Node::apply` (`runtime.rs:332`) retires consumed token inputs but never persists
  `TokenTx::outputs`; `is_valid_in_ledger` (`runtime.rs:199`) checks existence vs `ledger.cells` ⇒ multi-hop token
  flow impossible at the reference layer + on-VM single-use can't retire from an unwritten set. Naive fix via
  `ledger.cells` would POLLUTE the novelty index + `pom_scores` (both fold over `cells`).
- **DECISION:** token state = a SEPARATE `ledger.token_cells` set. Existence resolves token inputs vs `token_cells`;
  `apply` retires inputs from + appends `tx.outputs` to `token_cells`; `cells`/index/`pom_scores` stay token-blind;
  issuance authority cells seed into `token_cells`.
- **(k) crate-question DISSOLVED:** reference layer = a runtime `Ledger` field (NOT index-rule, NOT a new crate);
  the on-VM type-script crate question only arises at the on-VM PORT.
- **NEXT BUILD (fresh context, scoped):** (1) `token_cells: Vec<Cell>` on `Ledger`; (2) point existence at it + seed
  issuance; (3) `apply` retire-then-append on `token_cells`; (4) tests — multi-hop A→B→C validates; spend of an
  unpersisted output rejected→accepted; token movement leaves `pom_scores` unchanged; cross-block single-use holds.
  THEN on-VM single-use per (k)'s SMT-membership + rolling-root decision. pushed `b914b59` (master, WGlynn/noesis).

### prior — (k) on-VM single-use DECISION (the build AFTER token-state persistence)
- on-VM single-use = committed-UTXO-set membership + rolling-root retirement, consensus-sourced, sentinel-gated inert
  (index-dep / header-`now` class). (1) existence = SMT membership proof of each input's `(id+lock+type_script)` vs the
  live-UTXO-set root in a cell-dep (consensus-head-sourced); (2) single-use = spent input deleted in the output
  state-root transition (rolling-root deletion chain mirroring `index_rule::valid_root_transition`). Nullifier-in-effect
  WITHOUT a new nullifier type. New exits: input-not-in-set / input-not-retired. Will-gated: T1 transport.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-17 (j) — RSAW: double-spend / input single-use CLOSED at the reference layer; node lib 211→215)
- **BUILT — the (i) closure.** (h) proved input EXISTENCE but `apply` never RETIRED a consumed input ⇒
  a real authority cell could be respent. FIX at both scopes, keyed on the (h) identity tuple
  (`id + lock + type_script`), no producer-asserted nullifier: (1) within-block — `validate` →
  `token_txs_conserve_and_single_use` folds a `consumed: HashSet` across `token_txs` and rejects reuse
  (also catches intra-tx dup inputs); (2) cross-block — `apply` retires each consumed input from
  `ledger.cells` before appending, so a later block's existence check fails for a spent cell. +4 tests
  (within-block dup rejected / cross-block respend rejected / distinct inputs still validate / existence
  ∧ single-use compose). node lib 211→215, integration green (two_node/byzantine/gaming — empty
  `token_txs` ⇒ retire is a no-op), 0 new clippy (27 pre-existing).
- **HONEST SCOPE:** reference-layer in-memory UTXO retirement; the crypto nullifier set + on-VM
  UTXO-set retirement are the deploy-coupled layer (same boundary as index-dep / header-`now` / lock-sig).
- **NEXT RSAW target:** on-VM enforcement of single-use — the type-script must reject a tx whose input
  is absent from the live UTXO set / present in a nullifier set (deploy-coupled crypto layer); OR
  continue the pure-additive gap list — the full-tx pipeline (#4-next) that PERSISTS outputs into a
  token ledger is the natural partner of retiring inputs, or genesis/chain-spec (#1). Will-gated: T1 transport.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-16 (g) — RSAW: pinned the input-authenticity residual of the (f) fix; suite 262)
- **PINNED (no code change) — the honest residual of (f).** The derived-minter fix relocated trust to
  the AUTHENTICITY of the consumed authority input; pre-sig / pre-ledger an attacker can FABRICATE an
  authority cell naming the issuer as owner and mint. Test
  `derived_mint_authority_is_input_authenticity_bound_open_residual` documents it (asserts the gate
  accepts a fabricated authority today) + names the close: lock-sig + ledger-input-existence layer.
  suite 261→262 (+1 doc-pin). Not assume-closed.
- **NEXT BUILD (crisp contract now):** verify each tx input EXISTS in the ledger AND lock-sig proves
  control of its claimed owner ⇒ a fabricated authority cell can never enter `inputs`. This is the
  lock-sig + ledger-input layer; it closes the 8th attacker-input site cryptographically and is the
  natural partner of the full-tx pipeline (#4-next). Alternatively genesis/chain-spec (#1).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-16 (f) — RSAW: derived mint authority closes the self-declared-minter vector; suite 261)
- **HARDENED — adversarial-gaming tick on the (e) token gate.** RSAW found a vector I introduced in (e):
  `TokenTx` carried a producer-asserted `minter` field, and `is_valid` authorized a mint by `minter == args`
  ⇒ anyone mints any token by naming itself the issuer. **8th site of `[P·dont-let-attacker-choose-critical-input]`.**
  FIX: removed the `minter` field; the runtime DERIVES it from issuer control of a consumed authority cell
  (an input of this token whose owner `lock.args` == issuer `args`). Non-issuer ⇒ minter can't match ⇒
  mint rejected; transfers/burns unaffected; empty-issuer guard makes the sentinel sound. +2 regression
  tests (`mint_authority_cannot_be_self_declared`, `issuer_mints_by_spending_its_authority_cell`).
  lib 208→210, suite 259→261, 0 new clippy.
- **HONEST SCOPE:** reference-layer / pre-deploy. `lock.args` stands in for the verified owner; binding it
  to a checked signature (verify the issuer actually signed) is the deploy-coupled lock-sig layer (same
  pattern as index-dep / header-`now` — structure now, crypto-enforcement at deploy). Multi still has no
  mint path (conservation only).
- **NEXT:** the lock-sig layer (bind `lock.args` owner-proxy to a verified signature) closes this site
  cryptographically; OR continue the pure-additive gap list — genesis/chain-spec (#1, also the natural home
  for the FIRST token allocation now that runtime mint needs an issuer authority cell), or the full-tx
  pipeline (#4-next) that makes `token_txs` move state. Will-gated: T1 transport; PoM-distribution audit.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-16 (e) — gap #4: token conservation WIRED INTO block validation; suite 259)
- **SHIPPED — gap #4 (block-validation half): token conservation at the block gate.**
  `node/src/runtime.rs`: new `TokenTx` + `TokenStandard{Fungible,Nft,Multi}` carry a value-movement
  (inputs→outputs, issuer `args`, authorizing `minter`) inside a `Block` (new `token_txs` field, empty
  by default ⇒ existing blocks unaffected; `Block::with_token_txs` builder). `TokenTx::is_valid`
  single-sources the `tokens` reference analogs (fungible/nft `mint_or_conserve`, multi `conserves`).
  `Node::validate` gains check (5): a block carrying ANY non-conserving / unauthorized-mint movement
  is REJECTED before finalization — value cannot be forged into a finalized block. PURE-ADDITIVE
  (no core/mechanism change). +2 runtime tests (unauthorized-mint rejected; conserving split
  validates). lib 206→208, full suite 257→259, 0 new clippy (3 runtime.rs hits all pre-existing:
  Constitution doc / state_digest complex-type).
- **HONEST SCOPE — VALIDATION ONLY.** `apply` still does NOT spend inputs / persist outputs into a
  token-state ledger; that's the full-tx pipeline (lock-sig verify + type-script run + token ledger),
  deploy-coupled = the gap #4 NEXT layer. The gate is the half that earns its place today: a
  non-conserving block can't finalize. Multi has no issuer-mint path in the starter analog ⇒ pure
  conservation only (noted in code).
- **GAP LIST status now:** #4 block-validation half ✓ · #7 Byzantine 2-node ✓ (already shipped).
  Remaining pure-additive: genesis/chain-spec (#1), block/cell wire-serialization (#2),
  state-rent/capacity/fee (#3), full-tx pipeline + token-state ledger (#4 next), mempool policy (#5),
  equivocation-in-round-loop (#6), sync/late-joiner (#8), VRF leader (#9), persistence (#10),
  header-clock (#11), confirmation-tier API (#12).
- **IMMEDIATE NEXT BUILD:** continue the pure-additive gap list — genesis/chain-spec (#1) is the next
  natural one for a real 2-node testnet, or the full-tx pipeline (#4-next) that makes `token_txs`
  actually MOVE state. Still Will-gated: T1 transport (FOUNDATIONAL, confirm before build); audit PoM
  validator/identity distribution before shipping finality (PoM=60%=kingmaker).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-16 (d) — ERC tokens shipped + research landed + GAP LIST)
- **SHIPPED — T8 ERC token analogs** `node/src/tokens.rs` (9 token cases; suite 247 green): fungible/ERC-20 (sUDT-style,
  conservation + issuer-only mint + burn), nft/ERC-721 (id-set preserved, duplicate=forgery, issuer-only
  new ids), multi/ERC-1155 (per-id independent conservation). T7 baked in: conservation is a PURE function
  of the tx — no oracle, airgap closed. cargo test 247/247.
- **RESEARCH LANDED** (full detail `internal/RESEARCH-NETWORK-CONSENSUS.md`):
  - T1 transport → **rust-libp2p lean** (QUIC + GossipSub v1.2 + custom RFC0012 addr-gossip, skip DHT);
    tentacle #2 (lightest, TCP-only). FOUNDATIONAL ⇒ Will-confirm before build.
  - T2 ML-consensus → role-bounded learned signal VALIDATES our design; safe add = CLAMPED deterministic
    weight multiplier (constitutional clamp), VRF leader-shortlist, anomaly pre-filter. DO-NOT: float on
    consensus path / score gates finality / model-agreement-as-truth.
  - T3 PoW finality-lag → **‼ latent bug**: `finalizes_hybrid` counts reorgeable PoW weight as final.
    FIX (#1): PoW OUT of finality, PoS+PoM gadget on a lagging ordering-prefix, renormalized 2/3-of-set,
    **anti-concentration rule (no single dim ≥2/3 ⇒ PoM-60% can't capture)**, accountable slashing,
    weak-subjectivity. AUDIT PoM distribution before shipping (PoM = finality kingmaker).
  - T9 Ergo sub-blocks → **adopt**: two-tier (sub-blocks fast/revertible, ordering blocks = PoM finality
    checkpoints), gate re-derived from contribution-weight not PoW, compact weak-ID propagation, honest
    soft≠final confirmation-tier API.
  - T10 Constellation → mostly hype; salvage only standing-weighted GossipSub peer-scoring (converges w/ T1).
  - T11 Solana-PoS-vs-value-native → agent still running.
  - **Convergence**: libp2p+GossipSub(standing-scored) · two-tier sub/ordering blocks · PoS+PoM finality
    (PoW out) · learned signal clamped+deterministic. Coherent stack, cross-validated by independent agents.
- **GAP LIST — what's still unnamed but needed for a real 2-node testnet** (Will: "think of anything I missed"):
  1. **Genesis / chain-spec** — shared genesis (initial validator set + standing dist + the constitution cell) so 2 nodes start identical.
  2. **Block/cell wire serialization** — canonical encoding for gossip (commit_order has one; blocks/cells don't).
  3. **State-rent / capacity / fee model** — CKB "1 PoM = 1 byte"; spam bound + native-token issuance (JUL=money / VIBE=gov / CKB-native=state-rent roles).
  4. **Full tx-validation pipeline** — lock-sig verify + type-script run; WIRE T8 token conservation into runtime block validation.
  5. **Mempool policy** — admission / eviction / priority (anti-spam); currently a naive Vec.
  6. **Equivocation detection + slashing in the round loop** — dispute/consensus modules exist but the runtime never calls them.
  7. **Byzantine 2-node test** — faulty proposer + equivocation rejected by honest node (RSAW next, pure-additive).
  8. **Sync / late-joiner** — download + verify finalized prefix (real "2nd node joins").
  9. **VRF leader selection** — fair rotation; runtime currently has a fixed leader.
  10. **Persistence** — ledger is in-memory only.
  11. **Header/clock** — `now` must be header-sourced (T3); runtime uses height.
  12. **Confirmation-tier API** — soft (sub-block) vs final (ordering block), per T9.
- **✅ SHIPPED — T3 finality fix + T11:** `runtime::finality::finalizes_pos_pom` (3 tests, suite 250):
  PoW removed from finality (`FINALITY_MIX={pow:0,pos:1/3,pom:2/3}`), 2/3-of-fast-final-set, +
  anti-concentration `MIN_DIM_BPS` (each of PoS/PoM must independently clear its floor ⇒ PoM-60% cannot
  unilaterally finalize = T11 capital-orthogonality in code). Core `finalizes_hybrid` (235-test) intact.
  T11 verdict recorded: PoS = pure capital-at-risk × time-lock + VRF + Phragmén; intrinsic value stays in
  PoM, NEVER in security weight (Minotaur fungibility + Buterin subjectivity + filter-coincidence).
- **IMMEDIATE NEXT BUILD (continuing):** gap #4 — wire T8 token conservation into the runtime's block
  validation (a finalized block carrying token cells must conserve); then gap #7 — Byzantine 2-node test
  (faulty proposer / equivocation rejected by the honest node). Both pure-additive (no core change).
  THEN Will-gated: T1 transport choice (rust-libp2p vs tentacle — FOUNDATIONAL, confirm before build),
  T5 shard+commit-reveal+pairwise wiring, T9 two-tier sub/ordering blocks, genesis/chain-spec (gap #1).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-16 (c) — NODE RUNTIME + 2-NODE CONVERGENCE shipped; 6 design/research threads armed)
- **MILESTONE — first multi-replica run of the state machine.** New `node/src/runtime.rs`
  (orchestration ONLY, ~215 LoC, NO new mechanism): `Constitution` (value-matrix governance frame),
  `Ledger` (cells + novelty-index + PoM + height), `Block` (commit-reveal batch, canonical-ordered via
  `commit_order`), `Node` (submit/propose/validate/apply), `finalizes` (wraps `consensus::finalizes_hybrid`).
  Wires the existing modules into a deterministic block loop. `node/tests/two_node.rs` 3/3 green:
  (1) two replicas hold byte-identical cells+index-root+PoM after EVERY block (deterministic SMR),
  (2) block assembly presentation-independent, (3) non-canonical reorder rejected at the order gate.
  This is the in-process milestone BENEATH any real transport — peer/gossip swaps in above the `Node` API.
- **DESIGN-LOCKED (Will 2026-06-16) — value-dimension matrix = MIXED 3-LAYER, NOT immutable.** physics
  (anchor-in-realized-downstream-flow + noise floor; near-immutable) > constitutional (amendment rules: a
  dimension admitted ONLY if it predicts realized downstream value — verifier-gated; weights bounded,
  no zeroing a real dim, redistribution non-plutocratic) > governance (weights within the bounded set;
  fluid). Boundary = the completeness/weights cleavage from [[value-disputes-are-incompleteness-bias]]
  ("fact-of-matter about completeness, none about final weights"). AugGov on the attribution surface;
  THRONE "mechanism serves, never rules" ⇒ governance proposes, the verifier disposes. Currently the
  `Constitution` STRUCT stub; NEXT = a constitutional CELL whose transitions obey the verifier gate.
- **OPEN THREADS (Will-armed 2026-06-16 full-auto; results → THIS repo only, never public):**
  - **T1 · SOTA peer-discovery transport** — CKB-SHAPE COMMITTED (cell/RISC-V-VM/type-script stays),
    TRANSPORT open. Will: *"better node peer tech might be out there."* Survey tentacle (CKB-native) vs
    rust-libp2p (Kademlia DHT + GossipSub + QUIC) vs discv5 (Ethereum) vs newer 2025-26. FOUNDATIONAL /
    hard-to-reverse ⇒ Will-confirm BEFORE build. [RESEARCH]
  - **T2 · ML-native / "intelligent" consensus** — ML maths to make finalization AI-native. The learned
    outcome `v(S)` already feeds the VALUE gate (Role-C bounded); question = should a learned signal feed
    CONSENSUS (weighting / leader-selection / liveness), and how to keep it role-bounded (can't mint /
    can't forge finality). [RESEARCH + DESIGN]
  - **T3 · PoW finality-lag** — eliminate or account-for PoW probabilistic finality vs PoS/PoM fast
    finality in the NCI 10/30/60 mix. Core question: does PoW GATE finality at all, or only liveness /
    ordering / sybil-cost? `finalizes_hybrid` counts all three dims at once today. [RESEARCH + DESIGN]
  - **T4 · value-matrix governance** — ✅ ANSWERED (mixed 3-layer above); code stub in `Constitution`.
  - **T5 · shard + commit-reveal + pairwise-comparison architecture** (from VibeSwap/JARVIS) MUST fit:
    `shard_of(cell, n) = id % n` exists; VibeSwap commit-reveal batch = the `Block` shape (have it);
    PsiNet CRPC two-round commit-reveal PAIRWISE comparison = the `outcome` module's Bradley-Terry
    surface (`pairwise_accuracy`). DESIGN: how per-shard commit-reveal batches + cross-shard pairwise
    verification compose with the single-chain runtime (shard = independent cell partition; pairwise =
    the verification/dispute layer). [DESIGN]

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-16 — per-certifier asymmetric clamp BUILT; lib 194 / full 235 green)
- **DECIDED (cf31d23) → BUILT.** `resolve_refuted_guarded` no longer gates the whole settlement
  on one `defendant_id`; it judges EACH certifier on its OWN standing. New param
  `certifier_keys: &[(u64, Vec<u8>)]` (the same key↔id join idiom as `juror_keys`/
  `conflicted_juror_ids` — no new channel) replaces `defendant_id`. Per certifier: look up its
  validator id, run `appeal_refutes_guarded(...,that_id,...)`; drop the slash iff that
  certifier's OWN PoM is load-bearing to the full-mix non-conviction (one-way ratchet acquits
  it), keep it otherwise. `bounded_shares` computed over the FULL certifier set so a spared
  certifier never inflates another's bounded slash (totals stay exact). Cancel-iff-≥1-convicted
  preserves the single-defendant acquittal (empty settlement, target not canceled).
  REDUCTION proven: one certifier ≡ old whole-settlement guard (the two prior call sites
  translate via `[(1,[1])]` grief / `[(7,[1])]` cartel-break and stay green). New mixed-panel
  coverage (honest [1]↔id1 dropped, garbage [7]↔id7 kept, totals exact; standing derived not
  asserted). dispute 25/25, lib 194, full 235, 0 new clippy. README+coherence stamped.
- **NEXT RSAW target (each fix reveals the next):** `certifier_keys` is the gate's new critical
  input — it MUST be consensus/standing-sourced, never producer-asserted (the same
  dont-let-attacker-choose-a-critical-input class as header-`now` / reveal-coords / the
  index-binding identity). An unmapped key currently defaults to UNPROTECTED (id u64::MAX,
  conservative) which is safe, but a forged key↔id join that maps a garbage certifier onto an
  honest holder's id would steal the clamp. Bind the join to the on-VM standing set + add the
  binding test. STILL DECLINED (YAGNI): the `RECUSED_DIM` abstraction (one appeal court exists).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-15 — asymmetric-appeal guard WIRED END-TO-END; +2 tests, lib 194)
- **DECIDED → WIRED.** Will-armed 2-increment loop in a fresh context closed BOTH halves of the
  prior NEXT target. (1) `dispute::defendant_holds_downweighted_dim` — the guard's flag is now
  DERIVED by a counterfactual on the defendant's OWN PoM (`!full_mix_convicts(panel) &&
  full_mix_convicts(panel minus the defendant's own PoM)`); `appeal_refutes_guarded` exposes no
  bool channel ⇒ an attacker cannot assert past the clamp (the dont-let-the-attacker-choose-a-
  critical-input class, like header-`now`/coords). (2) `dispute::resolve_refuted_guarded` gates
  the slash on the guarded verdict ⇒ the clamp is end-to-end at the slash level, invariant
  `total_slash(guarded) ≤ total_slash(pre_appeal)` proven non-vacuously (real unvested entry +
  non-empty certifier share) and the cartel-break preserved at settlement. Tests:
  `guard_flag_is_derived_from_standing_not_producer_asserted`,
  `guarded_settlement_cannot_exceed_pre_appeal_slash`. Full lib suite 194 green, 0 new clippy.
  Committed: increment 1 `54b426e`; increment 2 this tick.
- **NEXT RSAW target — per-certifier asymmetric clamp — now DECIDED (2026-06-16), build deferred
  to fresh context (PCP-gate):** the gate is WHOLE-SETTLEMENT (one `defendant_id`) but
  `resolve_refuted` slashes PER-CERTIFIER, so a mixed panel (one honest-PoM certifier + one
  garbage certifier on the same target) is all-or-nothing. DECISION: `resolve_refuted_guarded`
  gains `certifier_keys: &[(u64, Vec<u8>)]` (the SAME key↔id join idiom as
  `juror_keys`/`conflicted_juror_ids` — no new channel) and gates PER SHARE: for each
  `(key, share)`, look up the validator id and run `defendant_holds_downweighted_dim(…, that_id,
  …)`; drop that certifier's slash iff their own PoM is load-bearing to the full-mix
  non-conviction, keep it otherwise. Build steps: (1) per-share gate; (2) mixed-panel test
  (honest dropped, garbage kept, totals exact); (3) single-defendant tests stay green
  (whole-settlement = per-share with one certifier). EXPLICITLY DECLINED (PONYTAIL/YAGNI): do NOT
  abstract the recused-dimension constant — one appeal court exists; the `RECUSED_DIM` indirection
  is premature until a PoW/PoS-minimized court is added. Re-evaluate then.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-15 — asymmetric-appeal guard: PoW/PoS appeal-grief CLOSED; node 232→233)
- **DECIDED→DEMONSTRATED.** Built `dispute::appeal_refutes_asymmetric` (§7.1c-guard): the
  PoM-minimized appeal court may only MONOTONE-DECREASE a down-weighted-dimension DEFENDANT's
  conviction (`pre_appeal && appeal`), a one-way ratchet toward acquittal. Closes the inverse of
  the §7.1c cartel-break — a PoW/PoS majority (0.90 of the appeal court) over-convicting an honest
  PoM defendant. Keys on the DEFENDANT's standing (not the jury's) ⇒ cartel-break untouched (PoM
  cartel sit as jurors). Test `honest_pom_defendant_vs_powpos_majority_appeal_cannot_increase_slash`
  proves grief real (full-mix acquits, ungated appeal convicts) then clamped. `cargo test` 233/233.
  Committed + pushed `fd407cf`.
- **NEXT RSAW target (each fix reveals the next):** the guard is a verdict-level boolean clamp. Open
  for the next tick — wire it into the live settlement path (`resolve_refuted` off the guarded
  verdict) and prove the slash-level invariant `appeal_slash ≤ pre_appeal_slash` end-to-end; AND
  bind the `defendant_holds_downweighted_dim` flag to consensus-derived defendant standing, never

## ▶ (2026-06-15 — value_v8: the learned outcome v(S) WIRED INTO the value gate; node 227→232)
- **THE MOAT SEAM CLOSED IN CODE.** `value_v8` composes the learned outcome `v(S)` (`outcome`
  module) INTO the v5→v7 realized-flow-gate SEED — the structural change v7 itself NAMED as the
  fix for its residual `structured_valueless_child_still_seeds_flow_open_gap` ("genuinely needs
  labels/flow, not bytes"). Until now `outcome::v_outcome` existed + was moat-measured but its
  authority was bounded to the EVALUATOR (advance/evidence) only; it was NOT in the value gate.
  Now it is: `seed_i = v7_seed_i × v_outcome_floored(w, lineage_coalition(i)) ∈ [0,1]`.
- **Mechanism (all reused, lean):** the outcome factor scores the cell's own
  provenance-lineage coalition (new `value::lineage_coalition` walker — cell + parent-chain), i.e.
  the connectedness/depth/synergy STRUCTURE the per-cell flow gate is structurally blind to. It is
  `v_outcome_floored` (entropy floor single-sourced from the intake floor at `theta_q16`), so a fake
  lineage of NOISE seeds 0 here too. AND-composed: multiplied into the seed ⇒ can only LOWER.
- **AUTHORITY BOUNDARY PROVEN (Role C, the load-bearing property):** corrupt model scoring 1.0
  everywhere ⇒ v8 ≡ v7 EXACTLY (`value_v8_corrupt_outcome_model_cannot_mint_above_v7`). The learned
  `v(S)` gains the power to DENY valueless certification and NO MORE — never to mint. This is why a
  corrupt outcome model is harmless by construction; v8 inherits the evaluator's bound at the gate.
- **+5 tests, node 227→232, full suite green (191 lib + 41 integration), 0 regressions, 0 new clippy
  warnings (24 pre-existing, all outside the new lines).** Tests: dampens-the-residual,
  pays-a-genuinely-useful-lineage, fake-lineage-of-noise-seeds-nothing, corrupt-model-cannot-mint,
  backstop-own-value-survives.
- **HONEST SCOPE (build-don't-claim, verified by probe not asserted):** with only SYNTHETIC
  structural labels a valueless child ATTACHED TO A REAL ROOT inherits genuine lineage ⇒ the gate
  DAMPENS its seed (~0.42×, v8[0]=14.58 vs v7[0]=18.12) rather than zeroing it. The
  fake-lineage-of-NOISE subclass IS fully zeroed (entropy floor). FULL closure of
  structured-but-valueless still rides the SAME pending **real DeepFunding-distill-over-sets label
  pull** — but the seam is now wired end-to-end (`load_prefs`→`train`→`v_outcome_floored`→seed) and
  runs UNCHANGED when real labels land; a label pricing the lineage ~0 drives g→0 ⇒ seed→0.
- **NEXT 🟡:** the real-outcome label pull (THE moat data — now the ONLY missing input for both the
  held-out harness AND the v8 gate; everything code-side is wired); then v8 → on-VM (the outcome
  model is f64, needs the fixed-point/no_std treatment value_fixed got before it can run in the
  type-script); finalization/ordering coord+registry binding (deploy-coupled); lean backlog
  (single-source the other cores, split the 6k-line lib.rs).
- ‼ STALE-FIX: prior top block claimed HEAD `ec36f18`/node 221; sessions continued past it (dispute
  7.1b/7.1c + outcome load_prefs ⇒ HEAD was `d86ab5e`/node 227 before this block). True-up done here.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 late — 5-increment session: ordering port + RSAW + moat + spoof-closure; node 212→221, pushed `ec36f18`)
- **+ pom-roadmap tick** (`ec36f18`): `outcome::v_outcome_floored` AND-composes the entropy floor
  into the learned `v(S)` (single-sourced with the intake floor) ⇒ the fake-lineage NOISE spoof
  scores **0** at the score (not just contained below); real work keeps its value. node 220→221.
  Test `semantic_floor_closes_the_fake_lineage_spoof_at_the_score`. ROADMAP Phase-1 marks updated.
- **Item 2 — on-VM ORDERING PORT shipped** (`36d1bfc`): `onchain/commit-order-typescript` ELF runs
  `is_canonical_order` on-VM (0 canonical / 40 non-canonical / 41 malformed). `noesis_core::commit_order`
  gained parse_batch/encode_batch (single-source). 6 e2e tests. Coord provenance (height←header,
  secret←reveals) is `COORDS_BOUND=false` inert pre-deploy (the deploy-coupled pin).
- **Item 4 — RSAW found + fixed a REAL break** (`291d30a`): finalization accepted DUPLICATE vote
  indices ⇒ `[0,0,0]` double-counted validator 0's weight and forged finalization from one voter.
  `parse_votes` now rejects duplicates; test `duplicate_vote_indices_cannot_inflate_weight`. Also
  pinned: the finalize PARAMS (threshold/floor/horizon/mix) are as attacker-chosen as `all` ⇒ the
  registry binding must cover the WHOLE finalization cell (inert pre-deploy).
- **Item 8 — THE MOAT measured** (`8fa8fca`): held-out generalization harness in `outcome` —
  `proxy_value` (coverage-only baseline) + `pairwise_accuracy` + test
  `learned_v_s_beats_coverage_proxy_on_held_out_coalitions`. Trained on 10 templates, tested on 6
  UNSEEN: learned `v(S)` ≥ 0.9, coverage proxy blind to lineage ties at 0.5. The un-gameable-`v(S)`
  gate measured not asserted. **Remaining mile = the real-outcome label pull (DeepFunding
  distill-over-sets); the harness runs unchanged when those labels land.** That is now the ONLY
  missing input for Phase-1 close, not the measurement.
- **Item 3 — GitHub/CI verified** (no commit): CI yaml valid (test + 3-crate riscv matrix, green by
  design), README mermaid renders, root clean. ‼ FLAG: `internal/` (front-run-sensitive RELEASE-PLAN
  + manifesto + this file) is committed — must be `.gitignore`d / stripped at PUBLIC-release time.
- **Item 5 — sync HARDENED** (JARVIS substrate, not noesis): `sync-public-substrate.py` now
  AUTO-DELETES stale public copies of skip-listed / newly-scrubbed files. On first run it removed **4
  real stale leaks** (clean copies of files that had since gained Pragma/nda-locked/jarvis-private
  refs). Public substrate verified clean, pushed `3281d1a`.
- **NEXT 🟡:** the real-outcome label pull (moat data); finalization/ordering coord+registry binding
  (deploy-coupled, when block plumbing lands); header-recency binding; lean backlog (single-source the
  other cores, split 6k-line lib.rs). Toolchain: each on-VM crate builds standalone w/ `make elf`.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 night — REPO REORG: real-blockchain layout, kept lean; pushed `61c4155`)
- **⚠ PATHS MOVED.** This file is now `internal/CONTINUE.md` (boot hook updated). The 27 root
  `.md` were restructured to make noesis read as a chain, not an essay folder. Benchmarked vs the
  live bitcoin / go-ethereum / nervos-ckb / solana roots and matched their credibility signature.
- **New tree:** `docs/` = 17 protocol specs (WHITEPAPER, POM-CONSENSUS, ON-VM-FINALIZATION, ...).
  `research/` = 9 prototype `.py`. `internal/` = JARVIS continuity + manifesto (THRONE,
  WHITEPAPER-FOR-DAD, HANDOFF, this file) + the front-run-sensitive RELEASE-PLAN. Root = README +
  ROADMAP + STUDY-GUIDE + CONTRIBUTING + SECURITY + LICENSE + Cargo.toml/Makefile/rustfmt/clippy/
  .editorconfig. **27 root .md → 5.**
- **Root Cargo workspace** (`node` + `onchain/noesis-core`); the RISC-V type-scripts stay
  STANDALONE (own nightly + riscv target), `exclude`d from the workspace — build them with
  `make elf` or `cd onchain/<crate> && cargo build --release --target riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf`.
- **Added (minimal real-OSS set, NOT more):** LICENSE (proprietary/pre-release — Will chose
  no-OSS-license-yet during stealth), SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, Makefile, rustfmt.toml,
  clippy.toml, .editorconfig, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (host suite + RISC-V build = green checks),
  rewritten protocol README. **Dropped CODE_OF_CONDUCT + CHANGELOG as ceremony** (Bitcoin-lean, per
  Will 2026-06-13 "LEAN not vibe-coded extra everything").
- **Ref patches done same pass:** `scripts/study-guide.py` + `scripts/doc-coherence.py` now scan
  `docs/`; doc-coherence COHERENCE-LAWS path → `docs/`; `~/.claude/BOOT-MESSAGE.md` → `internal/
  CONTINUE.md`; `node/README.md` link → `docs/`. Gate green, study-guide regen, **212 tests intact**.
- **Standard now in force** ([F·noesis-is-the-ultimate-blockchain], Will 2026-06-13): noesis ≡ "the
  ultimate blockchain" ⇒ treat-as-such in execution (top-tier-chain rigor, code ∧ presentation).
- **NEXT:** unchanged frontier below — (b) on-VM ordering port (`commit_order` ELF) is the next
  deploy-independent build; then lean backlog (single-source 4 cores, split 6k-line lib.rs); the
  learned-`v(S)`-on-real-labels mile is still THE moat.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 night — finalization ON-VM PROGRAM shipped, Phase-3 step-2; node 203→212)
- **Build-order step 2 of `ON-VM-FINALIZATION.md` DONE — the consensus finalize rule now runs
  INSIDE the VM.** New crate `onchain/finalization-typescript` (riscv64imac ELF, 153KB, first-try
  compile): reads the validator set + params from the finalization cell (GroupInput), the vote
  index list from `witness[i]`, recomputes `finalizes_fixed` in Q32.32, exits 0/30/31/32/33/34.
- **`now` is HEADER-sourced, not tx-chosen — the 5th attacker-input site closed on-VM.** The ELF
  reads `now` from `load_header(HeaderDep 0)` (the u64 `RawHeader.timestamp` at byte offset 8);
  there is NO witness/arg channel for it. Headline test `now_is_header_sourced_not_tx_chosen`: the
  SAME cell + SAME unanimous votes flips finalized→rejected (exit 0→30) purely by changing the
  header timestamp, driven by the un-decayed quorum floor — an attacker who wants finalization
  can't inject a favorable `now`. (CKB header-deps are real chain headers, unforgeable by the tx
  assembler.) Same lesson as index-dep F1 + temporal-order coords.
- **LEAN (paid the debt at birth):** the Q32.32 finalize arithmetic + the cell/vote wire format are
  single-sourced in `noesis_core::finalization`; the node lib now `pub use`s them (the old in-lib
  copy deleted) and the ELF links the SAME functions. ONE implementation, unlike the 4 legacy
  flat-vs-modular cores still owed. Drift-guard (`finalizes_fixed ≡ finalizes_hybrid`) intact.
- **9 new tests, node 203→212, full suite green, zero regressions, warning-clean.** Harness gained
  `SYS_LOAD_HEADER` + `header_with_timestamp`. Coverage: finalizes / below-threshold / header-flip /
  missing-header-33 / quorum-floor-vs-reference sweep (on-VM ≡ reference at every now) / malformed
  cell-31 / malformed votes-32 / empty-group / second-cell-smuggle (whole-group iteration).
- **STILL PENDING (honest, deploy-coupled):** the **curated-validator-set-rejected** path —
  `REGISTRY_BINDING_ACTIVE = false` (inert pre-deploy), the registry type-id binding lands when the
  validator-registry cell deploys (the 6th attacker-input site, same shape as index-dep F1/F2/F3).
  Plus header-recency binding (assert the header-dep is the tip via `since`) — timestamp is
  consensus-bound today, but staleness of the chosen header isn't yet pinned.
- **NEXT 🟡 (deploy-independent first):** (b) the on-VM ordering port (`commit_order` ELF, header-
  height + reveal-XOR sourced — now has a header-serving harness to build on); (c) lean backlog
  (single-source the other 4 cores + split the 6k-line lib.rs); (d) multi-proof compression. The
  learned-`v(S)`-on-real-labels mile (Phase-1 close) is still THE moat.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 evening — full-auto loop: PM-17 closed both layers + Phase-3 step-1; node 203/203)
- **6-iteration full-auto run, all pushed to WGlynn/noesis (HEAD `488862c`):**
  1. `index_binding` reference model **F2-complete** — dep identity grew `hash_type`
     (`HashType{Data,Type,Data1}` + `DepScript` triple); forged dep reusing code_hash+type-id under
     a different Data/Type/Data1 rejected (`bound_wrong_hash_type_rejects`). 196→197.
  2. **on-VM mirror** — `onchain/pom-typescript/src/main.rs` `index_dep_bound` now compares
     `r.hash_type().as_slice()[0]` vs `EXPECTED_INDEX_HASH_TYPE` (=1 Type; ckb-gen-types 0.119, API
     verified not guessed) AND the overloaded `[0;32]` sentinel → explicit `const BINDING_ACTIVE: bool`
     (QA-port-2). ELF rebuilt riscv64imac, 22 on-VM fixtures green (binding still inert).
  3. `COMPETITIVE-POSITION.md` (Will Q: stance vs blockchain ecosystem — idea-axis ahead/uncontested,
     deploy-axis at-zero/pre-launch; gated on learned v(S) + real labels = the moat).
  4. lean: dropped unused `CoreMachine` import (`tests/common/mod.rs`), warning-clean.
  5. **`finalization_fixed`** (Phase 3 step 1, `ON-VM-FINALIZATION.md`) — `consensus::finalizes_hybrid`
     in pure Q32.32: `retention_q`/`effective_weight_q`/`base_weight_q` + max(eff,floor) basis + 2/3
     threshold, threshold+floor ceil'd (`bps_of_ceil`) ⇒ rounds AGAINST finalization. Drift-guarded
     vs f64 over a liveness×decay×subset sweep: agreement off-boundary + conservative direction
     `!(fixed && !float)` everywhere + exact-2/3 tie stays un-finalized. 3rd/last on-VM arithmetic
     surface after value_fixed + settlement_fixed. 197→202.
  6. RSAW edge tick on (5): horizon=0 / 100% threshold / zero-weight padding / empty voters / all-zero
     basis — conservative direction holds at every corner, NO break, edges pinned. 202→203.
- **PM-17 STATUS:** reference + on-VM both F1/F2/F3 + QA-port-1/2 closed; the ONLY remaining piece is
  the **activated-path fixture** (real deployed script-hash ⇒ exit-23 under live mismatch) — deploy-coupled.
- **NEXT 🟡 candidates (deploy-independent first):** (a) finalization on-VM PROGRAM (build-order step 2:
  read validator-set + votes + header-`now`; recompute `finalizes_fixed`; exit codes — but `now`/`all`
  must be header/registry-sourced not tx-chosen, the 5th/6th attacker-input sites); (b) the on-VM ordering
  port (`commit_order` ELF, header-height + reveal-XOR sourced); (c) lean backlog: single-source the other
  4 cores (smt/proven/value_fixed/semantic — needs core reorg) + split the 6k-line lib.rs per-module;
  (d) multi-proof compression. The learned-`v(S)`-on-real-labels mile (Phase 1 close) is still THE moat.
- **Cross-substrate note (Will, Odysseus #4121):** today's QA-port-2 (overloaded sentinel → explicit
  `BINDING_ACTIVE`) and F2 (data-shape → full identity) are the SAME anti-pattern as that issue's fix
  (presence-check → explicit `budget_is_explicit()` predicate). "Never overload an implicit signal to
  carry intent." Convergence-across-substrates = the abstraction is real (cf. OKF-convergence).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 — LEAN: single-sourced commit_order + LOC audit; node 196/196)
- **Lean-audit recon (story pick 5):** total **7,577 Rust LOC**, but `node/src/lib.rs` = **6,099**
  (80%, 23 modules in one file — the auditability target). ~40/60 code/test (healthy). Heaviest:
  value 850, dispute 646, consensus 494. ~460 lines duplicated node↔noesis-core (smt/proven/
  value_fixed/semantic/commit_order) = the single-source debt. `adversary` = 325 code, no tests.
- **Lean increment (story pick 6, iter 1): PAID the commit_order debt.** node lib now
  `pub use noesis_core::commit_order::{...}` — ~90 duplicate lines deleted from the monolith, the
  tautological drift test removed (197→196 = the deletion, not a regression). noesis-core moved
  node-side from dev-dep → dep (the lib links it). ONE implementation. Bitcoin-lean.
- **LEAN BACKLOG (next, low-risk-first):** (a) single-source the other 4 cores (smt/proven/
  value_fixed/semantic) the same way — but they're FLAT in core vs MODULAR in node, so it needs
  core reorg first (bigger, careful pass); (b) split the 6k-line lib.rs into per-module files
  (mechanical, big auditability win); (c) review `adversary` (325 lines) for over-construction;
  (d) fix the pre-existing `CoreMachine` unused-import warning in ckb_vm tests.
- Design constraint stays in force: [[noesis-lean-like-bitcoin]] — minimal mechanism, earn-its-place.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 — on-VM ordering port, portable half; node 197/197)
- **`noesis-core::commit_order` SHIPPED** (no_std port of `node::commit_order`): block_shuffle /
  canonical_order / is_canonical_order now compile into the on-VM crate, BUILD for
  `riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf`, and are drift-guarded ≡ the node lib (`core_drift_guard.rs`
  `commit_order_agrees`). This is the consensus permutation the index-cell type-script will verify
  on-VM. 196→197.
- **STILL PENDING (deploy-coupled):** wire `onchain/pom-typescript/src/main.rs` to SOURCE the coords
  — height from the commitment's block header, secret from the block's reveals — and assert
  `is_canonical_order`, exit on non-canonical, sentinel-gated inert pre-deploy (the index-dep
  binding pattern). The today's 7th-site pin gives the crisp contract: reject any coord the ELF
  can't re-derive from consensus.
- **LEAN DEBT (pay next):** node::commit_order + noesis-core::commit_order are two copies (drift-
  guarded). Per the lean constraint, node should RE-EXPORT from noesis-core (single source). Same
  TODO as the other cores. Do this in a lean-audit pass.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 — pom-roadmap-advance: 7th attacker-input site pinned; node 196/196)
- **Adversarial-gaming increment (cron tick):** the ordered index rule
  (`valid_ordered_root_transition`) dissolves producer REORDERING but still trusts its
  `CellBatch` coords (height, secret) AS CLAIMED. New test
  `ordered_rule_trusts_coords_so_they_must_be_consensus_sourced`: a redundant cell that LIES about
  its commit height (claims an earlier one) sorts first and BANKS the contested novelty, and the
  batch still validates (is_canonical_order only checks internal canonicity, not truth). ⇒ 7th site
  of `[P·dont-let-attacker-choose-critical-input]`: the coords themselves must be consensus-sourced
  on-VM (header height + revealed secret), never producer-asserted. node 195→196.
- The invariant now spans 7 sites: code_hash / now-finalization / temporal-order / index-dep /
  finalization-now / validator-set / ordered-rule-coords. All negative-tested reference-side; all
  closed on-VM at GATE 2 of `RELEASE-PLAN-VIBESWAP-ON-NOESIS.md` (header/consensus-sourcing).
- **NEXT:** on-VM ordering port now has a CRISP contract — the ELF must source height from the
  commitment's header and the XOR seed from the block reveals, and reject any coord it can't
  re-derive from consensus. Build candidates unchanged: (a) on-VM ordering port; (c) finalization
  mirror; (d) multi-proof compression.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 — RSAW "attack it / make it nuclear-proof" pass; node 195/195)
- **Will: "audit and attack noesis, make it nuclear proof — or prove it already is."** 3 hostile
  adversaries (value / consensus / ordering+on-VM) swept the whole stack. VERDICT:
  - **Value layer = un-gameable BY CONSTRUCTION.** Sybil rings (v6 standing earned+soulbound),
    encoding-evasion (byte-blind v6 + content-agnostic dispute ⇒ negative-EV), corrupt-evaluator
    (authority bounded to timing, floors dominate), flow-DAG (damped d<1, external-only seeds),
    Q16.16/Q32.32 (saturating, tested to u128 headroom), all 6 composition seams — every one
    resisted with a STRUCTURAL reason, not a patch. No new break.
  - **Core ordering + SMT + crypto = CLEAN.** Shuffle slot co-determined (un-grindable), forged
    paths rejected (blake2b + domain-sep + path-dependent fold), today's ordered-transition holds.
  - **Every "REAL BREAK" found = ONE class: attacker-choosable input that must be consensus-bound
    on-VM.** index-dep hash_type + sentinel-overload = already pinned (QA-port-1/2), inert
    pre-deploy. The NEW residue: `now` and the validator-set `all` in `finalizes_hybrid` were
    outcome-determining but UNPINNED (no negative test), unlike temporal-order/index-dep.
- **HARDENED (this pass): pinned them.** 2 new consensus tests —
  `now_is_outcome_determining_so_must_be_header_sourced`,
  `validator_set_is_outcome_determining_so_must_be_consensus_bound` — demonstrate the verdict moves
  with each input and document the on-VM binding requirement. 5th/6th sites of
  `[P·dont-let-attacker-choose-critical-input]`. node 193→195.
- **Bottom line for Will: it is essentially nuclear-proof on every LIVE/reference surface; all real
  residue is the attacker-input class, now fully pinned + tested, and closed on-VM at GATE 2 of the
  release plan (header/consensus-sourcing — design-acknowledged, deploy-coupled).**

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 — commit-order WIRED INTO the index rule; node 193/193)
- **NEXT-BUILD (b) SHIPPED:** `index_rule::valid_ordered_root_transition` + `CellBatch` — the
  consensus commit-order is now wired INTO the index-cell transition rule at per-cell-batch
  granularity. `valid_root_transition` proved the root moved but TRUSTED the producer's step
  order, which is exactly what decides first-commit-wins when two same-height cells contend for
  shared novel coverage. The new rule gates on `commit_order::is_canonical_order` FIRST (height
  ascending, then XOR-seeded in-block slot — neither producer-arrangeable), then checks the
  flattened rolling-root transition; a producer-favorable reorder is REJECTED at the order gate
  before any root math (no silent re-sort ⇒ no probe signal). **2 new tests, node 191→193**:
  `ordered_batch_validates_in_canonical_order`, `producer_favorable_reorder_is_rejected_at_the_order_gate`
  (the second computes the canonical slot order, accepts that batch, then rejects its reversal —
  robust to whichever secret wins the shuffle). This is the index-rule half of the temporal-order
  fix; `commit_order` made order consensus-sourced, this makes the index cell REFUSE any other order.
- **STILL PENDING (honest):** the on-VM ELF port of the ordered rule (header-sourced height +
  reveal-sourced XOR seed + canonical-order exit code in the index-cell type-script), sentinel-
  gated inert pre-deploy exactly like the index-dep binding and the finalization mirror. Deploy-
  coupled (needs commit-reveal block plumbing live). Spec: `TEMPORAL-ORDER-ONCHAIN.md` §"On-VM".
- **NEW (Will 2026-06-13): the convergence is SEALED** — `RELEASE-PLAN-VIBESWAP-ON-NOESIS.md` is
  the master sequencing doc: the public VibeSwap protocol releases ON this chain as its deploy
  substrate, gated behind both the noesis Phase-1→3 roadmap AND a four-surface VibeSwap critique
  backlog (contracts / frontend-journey / wallet-security / accessibility — findings captured this
  session). FRONT-RUN-SENSITIVE: the convergence stays private until matured. Read it next.
- **NEXT BUILD candidates:** (a) the on-VM ordering port above; (b)✅ DONE; (c) the finalization
  mirror (`ON-VM-FINALIZATION.md`), same `now`-from-header invariant; (d) multi-proof compression.
- 4th site of `[P·dont-let-attacker-choose-critical-input]`: code_hash / now / temporal-order.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 — temporal-order fix SHIPPED reference-side; node 191/191)
- **The temporal-order attacker-input finding is now FIXED at the reference layer** (`TEMPORAL-ORDER-ONCHAIN.md`).
  The audit relocated the invariant to the order-source; this builds the consensus-sourced order that
  dissolves producer-favorable ordering at two scales:
  - INTER-block = commit-reveal block HEIGHT (a later height can't precede an earlier one).
  - INTRA-block ties = Fisher-Yates seeded by the XOR of EVERY revealed secret (VibeSwap
    `DeterministicShuffle`): a participant commits before reveals, slot depends on all secrets, so no
    one can choose their slot. Dissolution, not detection.
- **SHIPPED** in `node/src/lib.rs`: `pub mod commit_order` (`block_shuffle` presentation-independent,
  `canonical_order`, `is_canonical_order`) + `novelty_in_commit_order` value-layer wrapper. **5 new
  tests, node 191/191** (was 186). Headline tests: redundant-block-presented-first STILL earns 0
  (`cross_block_height_dominates_presentation`); the slot is co-determined not self-selectable
  (`intra_block_slot_is_not_self_selectable`).
- **STILL PENDING (honest):** the on-VM ELF port (header-sourced height + reveal-sourced XOR seed +
  canonical-order exit code in the index-cell type-script), sentinel-gated inert pre-deploy exactly
  like the index-dep activated path and the finalization mirror. Deploy-coupled (needs commit-reveal
  block plumbing live). Spec in `TEMPORAL-ORDER-ONCHAIN.md` §"On-VM enforcement".
- **NEXT BUILD candidates:** (a) the on-VM ordering port above; (b) wire the canonical-order assertion
  into `index_rule::valid_root_transition` at per-cell-batch granularity; (c) the finalization mirror
  (`ON-VM-FINALIZATION.md`), same `now`-from-header invariant; (d) multi-proof compression.
- This is the 4th site of `[P·dont-let-attacker-choose-critical-input]`: code_hash / now / temporal-order.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-13 — defensive audit via the attacker-input invariant; node 186/186)
- **New invariant captured** (public memory): `[P·dont-let-attacker-choose-critical-input]` — source
  security-critical inputs where the attacker can't choose them; a free/tx-chosen value is
  self-assertion, not a check; the recursive trap is that even the EXPECTED value must be
  attacker-unreachable. 3 cross-layer sites named (ordering/identity/time).
- **Defensive audit shipped** (`SECURITY-AUDIT-attacker-choosable-inputs.md`): swept the invariant
  across noesis input surfaces. 5 clean/addressed (content/index/proofs/identity/dispute), `now` =
  designed-pending (header-sourced, `ON-VM-FINALIZATION.md`), and ONE candidate VERIFIED against code:
- **Temporal-order finding (verified, node 186/186):** `temporal_novelty` orders by SLICE POSITION and
  never reads `Cell.timestamp` ⇒ the timestamp-backdating attack is MOOT. The real, narrower
  requirement: the ON-CHAIN path must source slice order from CONSENSUS commit-block height (not a
  producer-arrangeable list). Pinned by `temporal_order_is_consensus_critical_and_timestamp_is_not_the_lever`
  (redundant block earns novelty only when ordered first; backdated ts changes nothing).
  **NEXT BUILD (fresh session):** on-chain temporal path that fixes order to commit-height + a fixture
  that rejects producer-favorable ordering. Same invariant as index-dep binding (F1) and finalization now.
- Earlier this session: index-dep binding ON-VM PORTED (`e942f5c`; F1/F2/F3, exit 23, 19 ckb-vm tests
  green, sentinel-unset = inactive pre-deploy) + port qa (hash_type/sentinel gaps for the activated build).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-17 — tick on full T7: DOUBLE-MINT found+fixed, node 176/176; loop2 2/3)
- **Adversarial tick on the complete T7 stack found a REAL break and closed it same
  iteration: INTRA-TX DOUBLE-MINT.** Two identical novel outputs in one tx each proved
  against the same dep root ⇒ same novelty minted twice (probe confirmed exit 0 against
  the pre-fix ELF). Fix: the program carries a sorted claimed-novel set across outputs —
  a later output's already-claimed shingles classify as OVERLAP (intra-tx first-commit-
  wins, the same rule per-block batching applies across txs), so the similarity floor
  kills twins and near-twins. Regressions: twin ⇒ 22, distinct novels both mint ⇒ 0,
  near-twin recycling ⇒ 22.
- Build note (recipe pin re-confirmed the hard way): ckb_std entry!/default_alloc!
  already declares `extern crate alloc` — declaring it again is E0259. Also caught: `cargo
  ... | tail` masks build failure ⇒ a && chain copied a STALE ELF once; recopied after a
  verified build. Worth a build-script hardening later.
- **Production binding — ON-VM PORTED 2026-06-13** (`INDEX-DEP-CODEHASH-BINDING.md`): the
  binding logic now COMPILES INTO THE ELF and runs on ckb-vm. `main.rs` has `index_dep_bound(0)`
  (compile-time `EXPECTED_INDEX_CODE_HASH` + `EXPECTED_INDEX_TYPE_ID`, F1/F2/F3) gating the
  cell-dep-0 root load, new exit `23`. SENTINEL all-zero const = unset = legacy shape path,
  so the binding is INACTIVE pre-deploy and all 19 ckb-vm integration tests stay green
  (regression-verified, ELF rebuilt + recopied to `node/tests/fixtures/pom-typescript`).
  Host-side reference model `index_binding` (6 node tests) covers bound/mismatch/F3.
  **STILL PENDING (honest):** the ACTIVATED on-VM path (exit-23-fires) is NOT yet tested
  on-VM — it needs a build with the const set to a fixture value + a cell-dep with a
  mismatched type-script. That value is deploy-coupled (= the index type-script's real
  script-hash), so the activated-path fixture lands when the index cell deploys. Demonstrated:
  logic on-VM + zero regression. Not demonstrated: exit-23 firing on-VM under a live mismatch.
- **(superseded — design history)** Spec + adversarial critical-qa (qa flipped the design): expected index
  identity must be a **compile-time / consensus-pinned script-hash constant** in the
  binary, NOT a consumer `args` field (F1: attacker-chosen args = self-assertion, no
  binding); compare the dep's full **script hash** not code_hash alone (F2); `load_cell_type
  (0, CellDep)` → reject `None`, mismatch ⇒ new exit `23`; dev/test may leave it unset
  (shape path) so existing fixtures pass. **Survivor / next layer (F3):** code-binding ≠
  freshness — a stale rolled-back index with the right script is still code-valid; bind the
  CANONICAL instance via type-id singleton and/or consensus-head root match. NEXT budgeted
  session: implement the F1/F2 binding + ELF rebuild + four fixtures, then the F3 layer.
- **Loop2 COMPLETE 3/3** (checkpoint written: WAL epoch + SESSION_STATE + loop file
  deleted). **Next-session candidates**: bind index-dep by code_hash; index-cell
  type-script deployment; metered cycle measurement of a proven mint; multi-proof
  compression design.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-16 — T7 #4 COMPLETE: proven floors ON-VM, node 173/173; loop2 1/3)
- **T7 DONE — the execution tier (T1-T8) is COMPLETE.** Mint side now requires PROOF:
  every group output must prove its novelty against the live index root (cell-dep 0,
  32 raw bytes) via the canonical witness blob (concatenated 64×32B sibling paths,
  sorted-unique order, nothing else). The program STREAMS one path at a time (fixed 2KB
  buffer, no large allocation; length probed via partial-load before any verification)
  through `noesis_core::classify` + `floored_from_counts` — the same single-source
  functions the node drift-guards. Exit codes: 20 malformed/missing root-or-witness,
  21 classification failure (tamper/stale/omission-by-content), 22 mint denied
  (proven floored novelty = 0).
- **e2e green incl. cross-checks vs host-side ground truth**: novel mint 0, exact-replay
  22, tampered path 21, stale root 21, truncated witness 20, missing dep 20. T6-era mint
  tests updated to the T7 tx shape (one ordering fix: semantic floor fires per-output in
  order, so noise-first demonstrates 14 without proofs).
- **Honest cost note**: interpreter e2e suites ≈ 17s (≈37 shingles × 64 blake2b × cases)
  — the design doc's predicted cycle pressure, real. Multi-proofs = named optimization.
- **Loop2: 1/3 done. Next = adversarial tick on the full T7 stack, then checkpoint.**

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-15 — T7 #4 FIRST HALF: noesis-core no_std crate, node 168/168; loop 4/4 COMPLETE)
- **Split decision (WWWD, final loop iteration)**: full #4 e2e is the most intricate piece
  and this chat is deep past rotation ⇒ shipped the RISKY half (no_std portability) and
  left the witness plumbing for fresh context. **`onchain/noesis-core`**: no_std + alloc
  lib crate carrying the verify-side cores (SMT fold/proofs no-alloc, coverage,
  unique_shingles, novelty_with_proofs, proven_floored_novelty_q16, Q16.16 floors).
  Builds host AND riscv64imac. pom-typescript now LINKS it (local floor copies deleted;
  ELF rebuilt; all on-VM tests still green). Node carries `tests/core_drift_guard.rs`:
  core ≡ node-lib on every canonical fixture incl. the SMT root fold (hash
  personalization + layout bit-identical) — duplication is now guarded until the lib
  re-exports from core (single-source TODO).
- **fnv constants verified against node source before shipping** (silent shingle
  divergence was the failure mode; checked, identical).
- **NEXT (fresh session): T7 #4 second half** — witness-served proofs (load_witness_args,
  molecule WitnessArgs parsing), index-root syscall, proven path inside program_entry,
  e2e in the T4-T6 pattern. Then T7 complete and the execution tier is T1-T8 done.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-14 — T7 #3 index-cell rule, node 165/165; loop 3/4)
- **`index_rule` SHIPPED (T7 #3)**: `valid_root_transition(old, new, steps)` — the
  per-block batched rule from qa R2. Intermediate roots are COMPUTED from each step's own
  proof (check non-membership under rolling root, then derive the next root), never
  producer-claimed ⇒ duplicate insertion is STRUCTURALLY impossible (second insert can't
  prove absence under the root that contains it) — zero dedup bookkeeping. Smuggled keys,
  omitted keys, forged paths all move the computed end off new_root ⇒ reject.
  **First-commit-wins demonstrated end to end**: both cells novel at block-start root;
  sequential assignment via evolving roots gives the first the shared shingles, the
  second overlap (its own tail still earns) — the consensus rule is now executable, not
  prose.
- **Loop: 3/4 done. Final iteration = T7 #4**: on-VM e2e — witness-served proofs
  (load_witness_args), index root via syscall, the proven path inside the type-script,
  T4-T6 pattern (same verdicts host-side and on-VM). NOTE honest scope for #4: the no_std
  port of `proven`+`smt` cores (alloc for Vec; hashbrown if needed) is part of the work.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-13 — T7 #2 proven verifier, node 160/160; loop 2/4)
- **`proven` module SHIPPED (T7 #2)**: `novelty_with_proofs` + `proven_floored_novelty_q16`
  — the function the type-script will run. **The T7 theorem is now IN-TEST**: proof-driven
  floored novelty ≡ the stateful sequential rule's assignment for the same cell, across
  fresh / exact-dup / near-dup / partial-overlap / sub-window candidates. Count semantics
  preserved exactly (novelty per-occurrence, similarity on unique-set fraction). Polarity
  DERIVED never claimed; canonical sorted proof layout; omission, padding, tampered path,
  and stale root ⇒ None (reject-whole, never partial credit). Noise still semantically
  floored through the proven path.
- **Loop: 2/4 done.** Next = T7 #3 index-cell root-transition rule (per-block batched
  insertion chain over verify_insert), then #4 on-VM e2e.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-12 — T8 settlement mirror, node 156/156; loop 1/4)
- **`settlement_fixed` SHIPPED (ROADMAP T8 ✅)**: the flow-gated rules in Q32.32/u128 —
  integer damped-Jacobi external flow (mirrors `value_flow_with_own` external-only),
  one-shot rational gate `nov·f/(f+half)` (integer division, RISC-V divu-deterministic),
  full `value_v7_q32` composing the Q16.16 intake floors with fixed-point settlement.
  Every op SATURATES (wrap would mint value from overflow — pinned by a 200-deep
  amplification-chain test). Tracks f64 v7 within 1e-6 relative on mixed-vesting content
  graphs; the flipped noise-child pin holds integer-exact (parent = 0); retroactive
  vesting monotone. Early-exit only on exact fixpoint (deterministic).
- **Both arithmetic tiers now exist in canonical fixed point**: intake (`value_fixed`,
  T1) + settlement (`settlement_fixed`, T8). f64 = prototype everywhere.
- **Loop: 1/4 done.** Next = T7 #2 `novelty_with_proofs` shared verifier (SMT counts →
  floors, no_std-compatible), then #3 index-cell rule (per-block batched), then #4 e2e.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-11 — T7 #1 SMT shipped + design qa'd, node 152/152)
- **SMT in `node` (T7 #1)**: blake2b-ref dep (proven recipe), depth-64 over CovId, ONE
  shared fold (`root_from`) serving membership / non-membership / insertion; off-VM
  `NoveltyIndex` maintainer (O(64) insert/proof). proof-property checks: order-independence (set
  semantics), mutual-exclusion (the omission kill), key+root binding, exact-transition
  insertion (the T7 #3 rule shape), complete-classification exact counts (the T7 #2
  verifier shape). All green first run.
- **T7 design critical-qa'd, 1 DESIGN CHANGE**: per-shingle sharding REJECTED by math
  (conflict ≈ S₁S₂/2^k ⇒ ~2^20 cells for 1% at S=100, no per-tx win) → **per-block
  batched root update** (prove against block-start root; producer folds novel shingles
  once per block; intra-block dup-novelty = consensus rule at assembly, like
  double-spend). Cycle budget pinned with real numbers (1KB cell ≈ 64k hashes).
- **Story-loop ARMED by Will (picks 1,2,4,5,6,8): 4 iterations** = T8 Q32.32 settlement
  mirror → T7 #2 shared verifier → T7 #3 index-cell rule → T7 #4 script+syscalls e2e.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-10 — T7 DESIGN shipped, no code yet)
- **`T7-CROSS-CELL-SIMILARITY.md`**: the history-dependent floors (temporal novelty +
  similarity) go on-VM via a consensus-maintained NOVELTY-INDEX CELL (SMT root over the
  seen-shingle set) + witness proofs giving COMPLETE per-shingle classification — script
  derives the coverage list itself, demands membership XOR non-membership per shingle
  against the consumed root ⇒ exact counts, floors run on verified numbers. Design-time
  adversarial walk: omission impossible (complete classification), stale-root impossible
  (UTXO liveness = freshness), front-running = commit-reveal layer's job (composition),
  cycle cost honest-pinned (multi-proofs; sampling REJECTED — breaks the exactness that
  defeats omission). Throughput serialization pinned (shard-by-prefix = calibration).
- **Next code increment = T7 #1: SMT in `node`** (blake2b-ref, no_std-compatible core,
  membership/non-membership/insertion proofs, off-VM tests). Then the shared verifier,
  index-cell rule, script extension + host syscalls (#2-4 in-doc).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-9 — T6 mint-side validation, node 147/147)
- **ROADMAP T6 CLOSED** ("noesis development", same chat): host serves Source::GroupOutput
  (`for_tx` + `run_typescript_tx` in tests/common), program iterates BOTH group directions
  until IndexOutOfBound — mint-side noise exits **14** (distinct triage code), consumed-side
  stays 13, honest mint passes, mint-only/burn-only groups valid, empty group ⇒ 12. ELF
  rebuilt. **Execution tier remaining: T7 cross-cell similarity (seen-shingle state via a
  Noesis syscall — the next real design problem) and T8 Q32.32 settlement mirror.**
- Survivor note: no NEW in-tier gap from this tick — the remaining attacks route through
  the already-named classes (encoding-evasion/out-of-band; cross-cell state = T7).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-8 — roadmap-advance: group-input iteration, node 146/146)
- **Will-ordered in-chat ("noesis roadmap execution story mode form") past rotation
  threshold — single increment, done right:** `onchain/pom-typescript` now iterates its
  WHOLE script group (Source::GroupInput until IndexOutOfBound; empty group ⇒ 12).
  **FLIPPED `on_vm_floor_checks_only_input_zero_open_gap`** — the exact smuggling tx
  (noise at input index 1) now exits 13 in-test; honest 3-cell group passes; ELF fixture
  rebuilt. ROADMAP execution-layer tier marks T1-T8 added (T1-T5 ✅).
- **Adversarial tick survivor (pinned in ROADMAP T6, doc-pin not test-pin — host cannot
  express outputs yet):** group OUTPUTS are not validated — mint-side noise passes. Next:
  host serves Source::GroupOutput + program iterates both directions; then T7 cross-cell
  similarity state; then T8 Q32.32 settlement mirror.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-7 — value_v7 semantic-floored seeds, node 126/126; story-loop 1/10)
- **`value_v7` SHIPPED — flips `noise_child_still_seeds_flow_in_v5_open_gap`**: seed =
  `semantic_floor(floored_novelty)` on top of v6's standing gate. The SAME vested identity
  committing the SAME noise pumps the parent under v6 and pumps NOTHING under v7 (in-test
  contrast). **Load-bearing separation held**: only the SEED is semantic-floored, the cell's
  own gated value is not — so the airgap backstop survives (keyish cell still EARNS when
  built upon, in-test) while noise-shaped bytes certify nothing upward. v7 ≡ v6 elementwise
  on content-only graphs (in-test).
- **Adversarial tick: the layering CONVERGED** — the v7 survivor is structured-but-valueless
  prose (`structured_valueless_child_still_seeds_flow_open_gap`), which is EXACTLY the
  already-named out-of-band frontier (#3: labels/outcomes, not bytes). No new in-gate layer
  is available from content alone; per the method, that's a convergence signal, not a TODO.
- **Loop 2/10 — entropy_theta CALIBRATED (node 128/128)**: `semantic::calibrate_theta`
  returns the separating band (max content entropy, min noise entropy) over labeled corpora
  — zero empirical FP/FN for any theta inside it; `recommend_theta` = midpoint. The suite's
  0.95 verified strictly inside the band (stops being magic). **Airgap restated as
  calibration math + pinned**: one keyish payload in the content corpus ⇒ band = `None` ⇒
  no theta separates by bytes — the formal reason the floor is seed-only + flow-backstopped,
  never a verdict. Honest scope: corpus-relative evidence, not proof.
- **Loop 3/10 — critical-qa on the semantic arc (node 129/129): 1 real break found + pinned,
  2 honest annotations, verdict revise→shipped.**
  - **R-adversarial (REAL, verified numerically then pinned)**: encoding-evasion — hex-encode
    or zero-dilute the same garbage and entropy drops 1.0→≈0.57, under any workable theta,
    while shingle novelty survives (`encoded_noise_evades_the_entropy_floor_open_gap`).
    The floor's claim NARROWED in-doc: it stops accidental/lazy noise and raises the
    attacker's move to "encode it" — economic layers (v6 standing, dispute slashing) stay
    the binding defense vs the aware adversary. Encoded noise ≡ structured-but-valueless ⇒
    re-enters the already-named out-of-band frontier (no new layer owed).
  - **R-composition (doc fix)**: dual-"canonical" ambiguity resolved — production_value =
    canonical-at-INTAKE (boost form); v5→v7 = SETTLEMENT form (vests as use realizes).
  - **R-mechanism (annotation)**: the whole value layer is f64; the ckb-vm type-script port
    will need fixed-point/deterministic arithmetic — noted in HANDOFF frontier #2.
  - Confirmed-ok: short-payload edges (n<2 ⇒ passes, harmless), calibration honesty already
    scoped corpus-relative, empty-corpus None handled.
- **Loop 4/10 — ckb-vm APIs VERIFIED from source (no code yet, by design): `CKB-VM-PORT.md`.**
  Read on-disk crate source (`~/.cargo/registry`): ckb-vm 0.24.14 (`run(program,args,mem)`,
  ISA_IMC|A|B|MOP + VERSION2 + WXorXMemory, `DefaultMachineBuilder::syscall` = our syscall
  plug point, cycle metering), ckb-std 0.16.4 (`high_level::load_cell_data/load_script`,
  entry/alloc macros — matches the proven vibeswap recipe), ckb-script 1.1.0
  (`TransactionScriptsVerifier::new(...).verify(max_cycles)`). On-VM/off-VM authority split
  + per-function fixed-point map written down (similarity floor = exact cross-multiplied
  integers; entropy floor needs a Q16.16 log2 table — boundary-exactness flagged for its own
  adversarial tick). Next code increments ordered in-doc: (1) off-VM `value_fixed` mirror +
  equivalence tests, (2) ckb-vm host harness smoke test, (3) pom-typescript no_std crate.
- **Loop 5/10 — `value_fixed` SHIPPED (node 133/133): CKB-VM-PORT increment #1 done.**
  Q16.16 integer mirror of the full intake pipeline, zero deps: `log2_q16` (shift-and-square,
  16 bounded iterations, bit-identical cross-platform), `is_incompressible_q16` (entropy
  inequality cleared of division: n·log2(n) − Σ c·log2(c) ≥ θ·n·log2(min(n,256)), i128),
  similarity floor as exact cross-multiplied integers, `production_value_q16`. Equivalence
  vs f64 TESTED: log2 within 1e-4 across the range incl. u64::MAX; exact agreement on every
  corpus fixture (content/noise/keyish/hexed/diluted/empty); 500-payload deterministic
  random sweep across alphabet sizes agrees everywhere outside the documented 1e-3
  quantization band (>400 checked, in-test floor); canonical-fixture pipeline values match
  f64 exactly. The fixed form is canonical-on-chain; f64 stays the prototype.
- **Loop 6/10 — ckb-vm smoke harness SHIPPED (node 134/134: 133 lib + 1 integration).**
  CKB-VM-PORT increment #2. The noted blocker was already clear on this machine: 26
  prebuilt riscv64imac ELFs from vibeswap contracts-ckb + rustup target installed. A real
  PoM lock-script ELF (69KB fixture, in-repo) loads + EXECUTES under `ckb_vm::run` 0.24
  (dev-dep only; lib stays VM-agnostic). Assertion grounded in ckb-vm source semantics:
  ecall 93 = native exit, unhandled ecall ⇒ InvalidEcall(code) — reaching a CKB-numbered
  ecall proves real instruction execution up to the program's first environment call.
  Next: increment #3 = Noesis syscalls (back load_cell_data/load_script with our Cell
  model) under DefaultMachineBuilder::syscall.
- **Loop 7/10 — Noesis syscalls behind the VM SHIPPED (node 137/137: 133 lib + 4
  integration).** CKB-VM-PORT increment #3 first half. `Syscalls` host serves
  load_script/load_cell_data from OUR Cell model: exact partial-load ABI verified from
  ckb-std source, hand-encoded molecule Script table (stock ckb-std parses it), register-
  level protocol unit tests (full/partial/out-of-bounds/foreign-passthrough), and the
  prebuilt PoM lock-script demonstrably CONSUMES the served environment (served-counter
  ≥1 asserted; progresses past the bare-VM stop). Remaining second half: the pom-typescript
  no_std crate compiled to RISC-V under this host.
- **Loop 8/10 — pom-typescript ON-VM (node 141/141: 133 lib + 8 integration): CKB-VM-PORT
  increment #3 COMPLETE.** `onchain/pom-typescript` = Noesis's first mechanism code running
  INSIDE the VM: no_std crate (proven vibeswap recipe + pinned nightly), semantic floor in
  the SAME Q16.16 integer form as `value_fixed`, 173KB riscv64imac ELF (first-try compile,
  in-repo fixture + rebuild cmd in test header). Host refactored to shared tests/common.
  END-TO-END: content→0, noise→13 (floor fires inside the VM), empty soulbound args→11,
  and on-VM verdicts ≡ host-side value_fixed across content/noise/keyish-airgap/hexed-
  evasion — cross-VM-boundary determinism demonstrated, the exact property the fixed-point
  port exists for. Honest scope: semantic floor only on-VM; similarity floor needs
  cross-cell state via syscalls (named next piece).
- **Loop 9/10 — adversarial tick on the VM arc (node 145/145): host holds, 1 NEW gap
  found + pinned, 1 inherited gap pinned at the boundary, metering defense proven.**
  - Hostile registers (guest owns a0-a4): capacity u64::MAX / offset-past-end /
    offset+capacity wrap — host stays protocol-correct, never over-copies (saturating
    math holds, in-test).
  - Runaway-script economics: `run_typescript_metered` (estimate_cycles + budget) added
    to common; 500-cycle starvation ⇒ CyclesExceeded, 50M budget ⇒ completes. The
    unmetered harness is explicitly NOT production posture (in-test note).
  - INHERITED pin crosses the boundary intact: hexed noise exits 0 on-VM
    (`hexed_noise_passes_on_vm_too_open_gap`) — same containment as host-side.
  - NEW gap (this tick's survivor): the program validates input INDEX 0 ONLY —
    noise smuggled at index 1 passes (`on_vm_floor_checks_only_input_zero_open_gap`).
    Next increment for onchain/pom-typescript: iterate GROUP inputs until
    INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUND + the cross-cell similarity-floor state.
- **Story-loop COMPLETE: 10/10** (iteration 10 = checkpoint: WAL epoch + SESSION_STATE +
  loop file deleted). **Next move on this repo:** (a) on-VM GROUP-input iteration — flips
  `on_vm_floor_checks_only_input_zero_open_gap` — + cross-cell similarity-floor state via
  syscalls; or (b) Q32.32 settlement-layer mirror (flow/v7). Both designed; pick by delta.
- **HANDOFF frontier #4 SHIPPED**: `semantic::semantic_floor` AND-composed into
  `production_value` (new `entropy_theta` param) — after the similarity floor, BEFORE the
  quality boost. Incompressible noise now earns 0 at the canonical rule even at max quality;
  in-test contrast proves the similarity floor alone still pays it (semantic does the work).
  Airgap pin propagated (`production_value_semantic_airgap_pinned_high_entropy_value_floored`).
- **Adversarial tick (same increment, method-standard): the survivor named the next layer
  and is PINNED** — `noise_child_still_seeds_flow_in_v5_open_gap`: the semantic floor guards
  the boost rule only; a high-entropy noise CHILD still carries a positive flow seed in
  v5/v6, so a vested identity's noise commit pumps a parent's gate (bounded by v6 standing,
  not free — but real). **Next increment: semantic-floored SEEDS** — design first: the
  semantic airgap's backstop ("wrongly-floored useful cells still earn via flow") must
  survive; flooring a cell's SEED (what it pumps to parents) ≠ flooring its own gated value —
  those can be separated, and probably should be.
- Remaining frontier unchanged: real outcome-labels (external), ckb-vm type-script (verify
  APIs first), structured-but-valueless novelty (out-of-band).
- **PHASE-1 FRONTIER FIRST INCREMENT** (`outcome` module): the learned v(S) the coverage
  proxy can't be. `coalition_features(S)` = SET-level structural features (breadth, synergy,
  internal connectedness, lineage depth) the per-block proxy can't see; `train()` =
  Bradley-Terry over pairwise coalition preferences (the outcome LABELS = the outside
  signal); `v_outcome ∈ [0,1]`. Separates orphaned garbage from connected value on features
  content can't fake; learns orderings the proxy can't express; generalizes to unseen
  coalitions. **Safe by the authority boundary, not a robustness proof** — corrupt weights
  routed through `evaluator::intake_advance` on a fresh identity = 0.
- **Adversarial tick (same session):** fake-lineage garbage (chain of noise, each pointing
  at the last) SPOOFS the connectedness/depth features and out-scores orphaned garbage —
  pinned honest. CONTAINED: can't mint (bounded evaluator) + building the lineage is exactly
  what v6 prices + dispute slashes. The new layer inherits the protection below it.
- **Honest scope:** the model is built; real outcome-LABEL data (DeepFunding-distill-over-
  sets) is the unbuilt input (synthetic structural labels only so far). It informs the
  bounded evaluator; it does NOT replace the gate or auto-close the in-gate garbage-novelty
  proxy pin. Next: real labels; OR Role-C AND-composed semantic floor (close at the gate);
  OR on-VM type-script (ckb-vm). Study guide regenerates via `scripts/study-guide.py`.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-4 — role-bounded evaluator shipped, node 101/101 then)
- **PHASE-1 CORE BET REFRAMED + FIRST INCREMENT SHIPPED** (`OUTCOME-EVALUATOR.md` +
  `evaluator` module): the learned v(S) is NOT the gate (v5 settled that) — its authority
  is BOUNDED to (A) advance timing: intake liquidity `min(κ·score·floored_novelty,
  μ·standing)`, repaid from vesting, shortfall slashed at window close; (B) dispute
  evidence, never verdict; (C, research) semantic floor AND-composed (can zero, never
  rescue). Obligation collapsed: "prove model un-gameable" → "the bounds hold."
  Corrupt-evaluator test: score 1e18 ⇒ fresh identity 0, redundancy 0, vested leak ≤
  μ·standing and fully recovered. THRONE.md also shipped (telos doc, 8 mechanism-grounded
  correspondences). **97 → 101 green.**
- **Open next increments:** learned model itself (Bradley-Terry exists; outcome-set
  labels pending); κ/μ + W/B/α/β one calibration harness; concurrent claims on standing
  (advance-shortfall vs dispute-slash priority — design before code).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-3 — escalation court shipped, node 97/97 then)
- **JUDGE-CARTEL COUNTER IMPLEMENTED** (design §7): round-1 PoM-only veto is no longer
  final — appeal escalates to the AND-composed full-mix tribunal (`Tribunal::FullMix` =
  NCI mix; a 40%-standing cartel is only 24% of that court ⇒ overturned, in-test);
  **juror accountability** = overturned veto bloc slashed `rate × voted-pom` (the
  load-bearing piece — attaches to the VOTE, so identity separation doesn't evade);
  conflicted jurors excluded (hygiene); appeal bonds double (2^k griefing bound).
  **Ceiling stated in code, never flips:**
  `full_consensus_capture_defeats_the_escalation_court_global_assumption` — ≥2/3
  cross-dimension capture defeats every tribunal; that is the consensus layer's own
  global assumption, no NEW surface introduced. **92 → 97 green.**
- **Value-layer hardening arc COMPLETE for this pass** (v5 flow gate → v6 priced
  identity → dispute slashing → QA hardenings → cell-layer wiring → escalation court).
  Remaining Phase-1 frontier returns to the LEARNED v(S): outcome-evaluator replacing
  the coverage proxy (the core bet), plus W/B/α/β calibration on real data.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM-2 — dispute module shipped, node 92/92 then)
- **ENDORSEMENT-SLASHING IMPLEMENTED** (`dispute` module, design = `DISPUTE-SLASHING.md`):
  windowed vesting (spendable at E+W; refutation inside W cancels unvested only — vested is
  finality-protected), challenge bond, PoM-only 2/3 + quorum-floor verdict (reuses
  `consensus::finalizes_hybrid`), DETERMINISTIC causal-share slash (zero-seed v6 recompute;
  `bounded_shares` keeps Σ ≤ canceled), λ·share+α slashing, β-bounty, γ-compensation on
  upheld, `apply_slashes` → standing. **The vested-certifier attack is now negative-EV when
  caught, and §4 inequality holds at p=½ for any α>0 (in-test). 77 → 85 green (now 92: +4 QA, +3 soulbound dispute-wiring).**
- **New pinned gap (adversarial tick vs the dispute layer, same session):** JUDGE CARTEL —
  a >1/3 vested-standing bloc vetoes every refutation of its own ring (2/3 bar cuts both
  ways): `judge_cartel_protects_its_own_garbage_open_gap`. Economic bounds exist (§5.3);
  structural counter pending. **Next increment candidates: juror-exclusion of
  edge-connected standing / escalation court / dilution-indexed slashing.**

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 PM — value_v6 priced identity shipped, node 77/77 then)
- **`value_v6` BUILT + tested** — closes the v5 sybil-ring gap by PRICING IDENTITY:
  flow seeds are standing-gated (`seed = floored_novelty` iff contributor's soulbound
  standing ≥ floor, else 0). A3 economics reached the value layer
  (`max_certifying_identities` mirrors `consensus::max_sybils`) — stronger than A3:
  standing is EARNED + soulbound, not purchasable capital. Ring cost 0 → K × earn-the-floor.
  Seed-gated not edge-gated ⇒ unvested newcomers still EARN (vested use pays them),
  certification transitive through unvested intermediaries, fully-vested graph ≡ v5.
  **69 → 77 green (now 85).**
- **New pinned gap (adversarial tick vs v6, same session):** a VESTED certifier endorsing
  novel garbage into a fresh-key pocket still pays
  (`vested_certifier_endorsing_garbage_open_gap`). No longer free identity-minting — the
  endorser is accountable + slashable. **Next increment: ENDORSEMENT-SLASHING** — building
  on later-refuted garbage costs the certifier standing (refuted-value dispute window ⇒
  `soulbound::Op::Slash`); design the dispute window + refutation proof shape first.
- **DESIGN SHIPPED (same day): `DISPUTE-SLASHING.md`** — full mechanism (windowed vesting,
  challenge bond, PoM-weighted verdict reusing `finalizes_hybrid`, deterministic causal-share
  slash via zero-seed flow recomputation, incentive inequalities, 7-point test plan).
  **Next code increment = implement the `dispute` module against the test plan in doc §6**
  (flips `vested_certifier_endorsing_garbage_open_gap`; new pin to add:
  `judge_cartel_protects_its_own_garbage_open_gap`).

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-12 — value_v5 GATE shipped, node 69/69)
- **`value_v5(novelty, downstream_flow)` BUILT + tested** — the Phase-1 composition fix.
  `value = floored_novelty × g(downstream)`, `g(f)=f/(f+half)`. Flow seeded by floored
  novelty (redundant children pump 0), EXTERNAL edges only (no self-certification;
  `flow::children_of_external` + `value_flow_with_own` + `downstream_flow_external`).
  Regressions: q=0 noise w/ zero flow → 0 (v4-pays contrast in-test); honest-but-low-quality
  built-upon work PAID; floor-before-gate; retroactive vesting. **62 → 69 green (now 77).**
- **New pinned gap (adversarial tick vs v5, same session):** two-identity ring of
  novel-garbage children pumps the gate (`sybil_identity_ring_pumps_the_flow_gate_open_gap`).
  **Next increment:** price identity at the value layer (soulbound-standing / MIN_STAKE
  economics, cf. consensus A3) and/or seed flow with VESTED value. ROADMAP Phase 1 updated.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-11 night — AFK full-auto run)
Shipped this session (all pushed to `WGlynn/noesis`):
- **Visuals embedded INSIDE every doc** (not a central file): WHITEPAPER (4), BLOCK-ECONOMY-SPEC
  (2), POM-CONSENSUS (4), CRYPTOECONOMICS (3 + misconception callout), COORDINATION-SCHELLING
  (4), COHERENCE-LAWS (AND-vs-OR), ROADMAP (2), WHITEPAPER-FOR-DAD (2), node/README (1), README
  (system map + rewritten landing page), CONTINUE (status map). Mermaid; renders on GitHub.
- **COHERENCE-LAWS L12 + L1 amend — "composition before weighting (AND over OR)."** Resolves
  *"does 60/30/10 break RPS?"*: **verified vs `NakamotoConsensusInfinity.sol:19`** — NCI is
  OR-additive (`W = 0.10·PoW + 0.30·PoS + 0.60·PoM`), so Noesis declaring AND is a real
  divergence, not a relabel. One-liner (Will): *"60% PoM is only dangerous if it's a 60% vote."*
  Plus a 6-objection devil's-advocate hardening (liveness ≠ safety-AND; independence is
  load-bearing on L2 ∧ L5; per-dimension provisioning floor; no laundering of NCI's OR-risk;
  the <50% single-proof cap is insufficient under correlation; tie-break must be
  content-independent, never weight-proportional).
- **Rust port: `value-flow.py` → `node/` `flow` module** — eigenvector value-flow (damped,
  bounds self-reference = §8 guard mechanical) + two-level recursion (2-player closed form +
  N-contributor reusing the synergy game). **node 22/22 → 28/28.**
- **Rust consensus module + RSAW adversarial self-audit** (`consensus` mod) — PoM-weighted
  finalization, retention-decay, 2/3 bar (single dimension can't finalize alone), capital-drift
  + symmetric-decay fix, all TESTED. **Self-audit found the effective-weight liveness fix opens
  an ECLIPSE surface** (shrink the denominator → attacker finalizes alone); a **quorum-floor
  hybrid** closes it (both demonstrated as tests). POM-CONSENSUS resolution updated. **node
  28/28 → 39/39.** Audit gaps logged in-code (A2 log-scaling/saturation, A3 sybil econ, A4
  lifecycle, A5 slashability-under-decay) — open.

**NCI finalize path VERIFIED (this run):** `finalizeProposal` = **2/3 supermajority**
(`FINALIZATION_THRESHOLD_BPS = 6667`) of summed retention-adjusted combined `W` — so 60/30/10
IS a finalization vote-weight (OR-additive), **but threshold-hardened**: the 2/3 bar sits above
PoM's 60% ceiling ⇒ no single dimension finalizes alone (capture needs PoM + >6.67% of a second
dimension). L12 refined accordingly. Next: fold the L12 provisioning-floor into a machine
coherence check; type-script PoM (RISC-V) + PoM-weighted finalization. (Separately, the
ethresearch GEV Part 4 draft on Desktop was formatted — outside this repo.)

## ▶ RESUME HERE (2026-06-11 eve — chat rotated at 214k ctx)
Shipped this session (all pushed to `WGlynn/noesis`, head `7842e4e`):
- **VISUALS.md** (8 Mermaid figs) + Desktop render `noesis-figures.html`.
- **COORDINATION-SCHELLING.md** — Schelling/inward-outward synthesis + equi-dependence
  keystone + **meta-security** (LLM+DeFi coordinate through JARVIS on Noesis) + invariant.
  Folded into WHITEPAPER §5.2.
- **COHERENCE-LAWS.md** (L1–L11; L11 = coordination-layer integrity ≥ max spoke surface).
- **Fair launch RATIFIED = genesis-burn** (provable > asserted). WHITEPAPER §10.
- **WHITEPAPER-FOR-DAD.md** + Desktop PDF `Noesis-in-Plain-English.pdf`.
- **scripts/harvest-noesis.py** (code-only pick-list, 9 buckets) + daily cron `41445bfe`
  (⚠ 7-day expiry — needs self-perpetuation for permanence).
- **Rust:** `node/src/lib.rs` — modules soulbound, ownership, value, synergy, **flow** (value_flow + recurse_two + recurse_shares = value-flow.py PORTED), **consensus**, **stability**, **harness**, **adversary** + `production_value`. **61/61 green at the time** (verified `cargo test` 2026-06-12; suite has since grown).
- Memory: `primitive_meta-security-coordination-hub.md` (local, discretion:internal; NOT yet MEMORY.md-indexed).

**Top next steps:** (1) ✓ DONE — `value-flow.py` ported to Rust `flow` module (eigenvector + 2-level recursion);
(2) make harvest cron self-perpetuating; (3) Phase-1 open (THE frontier): prove LEARNED v(S) preserves
strategyproofness. See OPEN THREADS below for the full list. Build green (61 at the time), verified 2026-06-12.

Public-side this session (separate, codeword-free): integrity root **re-attested + signed**
(drift was benign +2 files); leak-gate hardened (4 codeword sites scrubbed + self-skip
removed so the scanner polices its own public mirror).


> Read this first on a fresh session to continue the Proof-of-Mind value chain.

## What this is
**Noesis** (provisional name) — the value chain Bitcoin is mistaken for. Proof of Mind
(verified, synergy-weighted contribution) replaces Proof of Work for consensus. CKB-shaped:
Rust + RISC-V (CKB-VM) + Cell model + state-rent. **Core inspiration = Nervos CKB
(github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb), keep that lineage.** Full context: `WHITEPAPER.md`.

## Built + TESTED (demonstrated, not claimed)
- Python prototype: `block-ownership.py` (UTXO transfer-fold), `block-value-v2.py`
  (Myerson synergy), `value-v3.py` (temporal-novelty, strategyproof), `value-v4.py`
  (novelty × quality), `pom-score.py` (PoM = consensus weight), `value-flow.py`
  (eigenvector + 2-level recursion), `adversarial-game.py` (sybil/padding/collusion all
  → 0 under temporal-novelty), `reward-model.py` (Bradley-Terry learned v(S)).
- **Rust node** (`node/`, `cargo test` = 5/5): Cell model, lock script (ownership) +
  type script (encapsulates PoM), temporal-novelty value, pom_scores, shardability,
  ownership transfer-fold. CKB-attribution README.

## Key results / decisions
- **Value rule = temporal-novelty** (commit-reveal order): strategyproof by construction
  (sybil/padding/collusion earn 0). Inter-block = temporal-novelty; intra-block co-authors
  = Myerson (synergy). Composed with learned quality: value = novelty × (1+quality).
- **Cryptoeconomics** (`CRYPTOECONOMICS.md`): 1 PoM = 1 byte of state (CKB direct-port);
  issuance reinterpret (PoM minted by contribution, earned not bought); rent augment
  (PoM decay). **PoM soulbound** (non-transferable) → consensus/franchise; **state-bytes
  transferable** → medium of exchange; buy storage, not consensus.
- **3-token = RPS equilibrium** (capital/compute/cognition = state-stake / PoW-JUL / PoM).
  3 is minimal for non-dominated capture-resistance. PoW relocates to the **money layer
  (JUL)**, orthogonal to PoM. JUL NOT yet integrated (honest open item).
- **Consensus**: PoM-weighted + Nakamoto-Infinity fallback (`POM-CONSENSUS.md`). Stability
  = core/nucleolus. Slashing = invalid-reveal + refuted-value dispute window.

## NEXT increments (critical path, do-it-right + test each)
1. **Port Python → Rust** (continue): value-v4 (novelty×quality) + adversarial tests +
   reward-model (Bradley-Terry) into the `node/` crate. Idiomatic Rust.
2. **Phase 1 still-open** (🔬): prove the LEARNED v(S) preserves the novelty/strategyproof
   property; attribution-ring under the learned model; decay + reviewer-diversity.
3. **Type-script PoM program** (RISC-V) — the actual on-VM validation; integrate `ckb-vm`
   crate (verify APIs against the CKB source, don't assume).
4. **Cryptoeconomics open**: decay rate/half-life, contributor floor, JUL integration.
5. **Consensus**: PoM-weighted finalization + core/nucleolus stability in code.

## Honest load-bearing risk
The whole thing rests on **un-gameable `v(S)`**. The coverage proxy is strategyproof;
the *learned* reward model must preserve that. The adversarial-gaming loop is the moat —
keep running it against every new `v(S)`.

## Naming (LOCKED 2026-06-11)
- **Noēsis** = the network (the act of mind). Crate name; private repo `WGlynn/noesis`.
- **Noeum** = the unit / token (1 Noeum = 1 byte of state = 1 PoM unit; Ethereum/Ether shape).
- **Web-checked 2026-06-11:** no established crypto token named Noesis or Noeum (only a
  Solana NFT-game "Quantum Noesis" using the $SNS token, and a one-off Noesis NFT) →
  appears available. Trademark/domain check still TODO before any public reveal.
- Both names are in the leak-gate (`~/.claude/state/private-leak-patterns.txt`) — keep
  out of public during stealth.

## SESSION 2026-06-11 PM — shipped (repo renamed to noesis, from the old private name)
- **value-v4 ported to Rust** (`node/`, novelty × (1+quality), Bradley-Terry quality, normalized 0..1). Multiplication keeps novelty floor dominant: redundant cell = 0 even at max quality (tested).
- **3-attack adversarial moat ported to Rust** (sybil / padding / collusion-ring all earn 0; honest keep novelty).
- **SOULBOUND resolved in code** — `soulbound` module: soulbound is NOT a data flag (UTXO has no account to freeze); it is a TYPE-SCRIPT INVARIANT on the consume→produce transition. `valid_transition` admits only identity-preserving successors (accrue/decay/slash/burn), REJECTS any owner/contributor reassignment. Two-cell mint: transferable **capacity cell** (money) rides the ownership fold; soulbound **standing cell** (franchise) cannot move. `pom_scores` now keys by contributor (`type_script.args`), NOT owner lock. **node tests 5/5 → 16/16.**
- **doc-coherence gate built** (`scripts/doc-coherence.py`) — closes the docs-lag-code information asymmetry. code content-hash; docs stamped with the hash they were reconciled against; `--check` fails if code moved past stamp; machine-checks (no old-repo-name refs, doc test-counts == cargo). NOT yet `--stamp`ed, NOT yet wired as pre-commit hook.
- **Boot-bind**: `~/.claude/session-chain/private-handoff-loader.py` (registered in settings.json SessionStart, after session-state-loader) now surfaces this handoff at every boot — fixes the "reboot drifts to public task" class. Generic globs only, no private nouns in source (sync-safe).

## SESSION 2026-06-11 (eve) — visuals + Schelling synthesis
- **`VISUALS.md`** — 8 Mermaid figures (value pipeline, two-cell mint, 3-power RPS,
  consensus stack, inward/outward Schelling fold, fair-launch decision, ToM→ETM→PoM,
  mint↔sink). Renders on the private GitHub remote.
- **`COORDINATION-SCHELLING.md`** — deployment thesis: JARVIS-as-Schelling-point →
  same reconciliation fold at two radii (inward = coherent self, outward = network).
  Two load-bearing edges: protocol-not-platform; openness-is-what-makes-it-focal.
  Whitepaper §5.2 added.
- **Fair launch DECIDED (recommend): genesis-burn > chain-reset** — provable fair launch
  (pre-launch blocks auditable, PoM/value burned to 0 on-chain at launch height) beats a
  reset (asserted, trust-me). In WHITEPAPER §10 + COORDINATION-SCHELLING. Will to ratify.
- TODO queued: (a) **whitepaper-for-dads** (plain-language explainer); (b) **simple cron**
  that greps Will's own repos for items that DIRECTLY serve the noesis roadmap (indirect later).
- **DONE (a)** `WHITEPAPER-FOR-DAD.md` + Desktop PDF (`Noesis-in-Plain-English.pdf`).
- **DONE (b)** `scripts/harvest-noesis.py` (code-only, 9 mechanism buckets, ~614 candidates)
  + daily cron `41445bfe` (durable; 7-day auto-expire — add self-perpetuation for permanence).
  Output `NOESIS-HARVEST.md` (gitignored, regenerable).
- **DONE — Rust port continued:** `synergy` module = block-value-v2.py (submodular coverage
  value + **Myerson** graph-restricted Shapley, Data-Shapley sampling, deterministic SplitMix64
  PRNG, no `rand` dep). Tests prove cooperative game is load-bearing: synergy-Shapley ≠ additive
  Copeland (L1>0.02), Myerson restricts value to provenance, redundant→low marginal, sampling
  deterministic. **node tests 16/16 → 20/20.** Next un-ported: value-flow.py (eigenvector + 2-level recursion).

## OPEN THREADS — do next session
1. **Finish doc reconciliation** (Will: "they're all outdated… docs never lag code"). Systematic fixes across WHITEPAPER / BLOCK-ECONOMY-SPEC / POM-CONSENSUS / CRYPTOECONOMICS / ROADMAP / node/README / CONTINUE: (a) kill the owner-vs-contributor / transferable-PoM conflation (now resolved = soulbound two-cell, consensus reads contributor); (b) make temporal-novelty × quality the canonical value rule everywhere; (c) names (noesis) + test counts (16). Then `python scripts/doc-coherence.py --stamp` and install it as a git pre-commit hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`).
2. ✅ DONE — README rewritten (2026-06-11 night: system map + landing page; repo=noesis, private remote exists, push freely).
3. **COHERENCE-LAWS.md** — Will: "set laws/rules/standards of cryptoeconomic coherence." ~10 invariants drafted in-context (separation-of-powers/RPS, soulbound-franchise/no-capital→consensus, conservation-of-proof/GEV, mint↔sink balance, strategyproof-minting, closed-value-provenance, contributor-floor, append-only-slashable, core/nucleolus stability, two-axis robustness). Write it as the anchor doc the others reference.
4. **token↔proof mapping** — now RESOLVED by the two-cell split: PoM-byte = tradable **capacity** (state, money-ish); franchise = soulbound **standing** + VIBE validation; JUL = PoW/money. Buy storage, not consensus, ENFORCED (pom keys by contributor). Still verify vs NCI contracts (`a442fc5b`) before reusing labels (tokenomics-zero-tolerance).
5. Roadmap next code increment: port `reward-model.py` (Bradley-Terry learned v(S)) into `node/` and prove it preserves the novelty/strategyproof property.
6. **Living study guide** (Will: "a living breathing study guide locally that updates with its contents, so I can study and internalize it all over time"). Build `scripts/study-guide.py` → generates `STUDY-GUIDE.md` FROM the repo (so it can't go stale, same philosophy as the coherence gate): read-in-order path, per-doc one-line synopsis, module/file map, glossary of key terms (PoM / Noeum / temporal-novelty / Myerson / soulbound two-cell / core-nucleolus), the key decisions + WHY, test inventory from `cargo test`, and progress checkboxes Will ticks as he internalizes each piece. Wire it to regenerate alongside the doc-coherence stamp (and optionally the pre-commit hook) so it tracks contents automatically. Pairs with [F·will-learning-goals].

## Language decisions (general, saved to memory)
Saved `memory/primitive_language-decision-router.md` (domain→language router; substrate-fit ¬ popularity; full-stack map; **strengths-lens** = find a language's strength in what others call its weakness, same as treating any mind by strengths). MEMORY.md index line still PENDING (deferred under context-rotation — add it in the fresh chat).
